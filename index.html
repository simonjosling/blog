			<p>On the 30th March 2019, Charlotte and I set off travelling around the world for 6 months, taking a break from work, experiencing new cultures and visiting a lot of places we've wanted to go to for a long time.</p>
			
			<p>I'll be endeavouring to write a weekly blog here with a brief update as to what we've been doing and where we've been - hopefully with some pictures.</p>
			
			<p>For anyone that's interested, this will hopefully give you a way of keeping up with what we're up to and it will force me to regularly pen [type] something to remember the trip by afterwards.</p>
			
			<p>I thank Charlotte in advance for putting up with the hours I'll likely spend writing and re-writing this and the time spent trying to make the website code do what I want it to!</p>

		<h2>Treasure, Turtles and Bizarre Birds
		</h2>
		<p>North of Montañita lies the fishing town of Puerto López. It's a quiet place save for the waterfront, which hosts restaurants and a plethora of small beach bars geared up for serving cocktails in high season. Since we were visiting at the end of the rainy season (more on that later), they were all mostly deserted!
		</p>
		<p>We arrived in the afternoon and spent the remainder of the day on the beach. We based ourselves on the opposite end to the fishing boats, since every morning hundreds of fishermen land directly onto the sand with the night's catch, which results in a lot of detritus left behind in the form of stray fish or parts thereof. We also booked ourselves onto a boat to Isla de la Plata the following day, which was our principal reason for visiting the town.
		</p>

		<p>The boat set off the following morning at 9am for the 2 hour journey to the small island. Isla de la Plata differs geographically from the Galapagos in that it was historically part of the continental plate attached to mainland South America, rather than a volcanic uprising. Its similarities are in the rich ecosystem of wildlife that inhabit it.
		</p>
		
		<img class="size-4" src="assets/images/20190507-02.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190430-02.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
		
		<p>Our arrival got us off to a fantastic start, as a neighbouring boat captain alerted us to a group of turtles that swam right up to the surface around our boat as we were anchoring offshore.
		</p>
		
		<img class="size-3" src="assets/images/20190507-03.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190430-03.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
		
		<p>Once we disembarked, we set about hiking to the far side of the island in search of wildlife with our guide Adan, who gave us the history. The name Isla de la Plata has a few possible explanations. Literally “Island of the Silver”, legend has it that Sir Francis Drake set sail from the coast of Ecuador with an extravagant plunder of silver, so much so that his ship was too laden to effectively navigate the rough seas of the Pacific. In order to ensure safe passage back to England, he supposedly dumped a bounty of metal into the waters off the island. Such a treasure trove has never been recorded as found. Another explanation is that the name relates to the colour of the cliffs, which shine silver in the melting evening sun due to the whitewash of Guano from the large bird population.
		</p>
		<p>So, to the birds. Isla de la Plata is home to the fantastically named and dumbfounding <em>Blue Footed Boobies</em>. They are large sea birds wothy bright blue webbed feet, which they develop over the course of their life (they are not born that way) through a diet of sardines and flying fish, which contain a blue pigment.
		</p>
		
		<img class="size-3" src="assets/images/20190507-04.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190430-04.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
		<img class="size-4" src="assets/images/20190507-05.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190430-05.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
		
		<p>They catch their food by diving at 100km/h into the sea, so we were warned to keep our distance from them due to their incredibly strong necks and bite. This was easier said than done, given that they were perched near or on the path all the way across the island!
		</p>
		
		<p>The birds’ webbed feet are evolved to moderate the temperature of their eggs. They nest on the ground, which provides some natural heat, and they will stand on top of the eggs to keep them warm over the 45 days they take to hatch. Whilst we were technically visiting the island in the wet season which runs January to April, the rains had already finished early. This meant that the boobies had laid their eggs early by mistake. So, they were instead to be seen standing either side of the eggs, allowing the breeze to cool them.
		</p>
		
		<img class="size-3" src="assets/images/20190507-06.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190430-06.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
		
		<p>The cooling was necessary since the temperature in the wet season gets up to 45°C and aside from the few hours of afternoon downpour, the rainy season counterintuitively has bright sunshine for most of the day. By contrast, the dry season which runs May to December averages 18-24°C and has more or less complete cloud cover. So with blind luck we managed to get the best weather of the year for our visit!
		</p>
		<p>The northern cliffs of the island house birds <b>everywhere</b>, also including the Nazca Boobie and droves of Frigate birds. The blue footed boobies were tucked into the cliffs en masses above picture-perfect - if inaccessible - beaches with bright white sand and sapphire-blue water.
		</p>

		<p>Once we returned to the boat, we took to the water to snorkel around the coral reefs of the island. The reefs are in relatively good condition, since the island and its surrounding 2km of water form a national park where fishing is prohibited. 
		</p>
		<p>The visibility for snorkeling was pretty good and we spent a happy hour swimming with the colourful and exotic scholes. I even managed get a selfie with some John Dory fish.
		</p>

		<p>We were told we had a chance of seeing more turtles while snorkeling, which Charlotte's keen eye spotted in one of the deeper areas about half an hour in. Whilst it was already retreating, I managed to chase it down and dive to grab a video of it. Galapagos eat your heart out!

		<p>Overall it was a fantastic day trip and probably one of the highlights of our trip so far, what with the combination of the weather, the wildlife and my love of boating.

		<h2>Montañita - sun, sand and surf</h2>
		
		<p>We arrived in the seaside town of Montañita at around 8.30am, dazed from a 9 hour overnight bus from Baños to Santa Elena and a 1.5 hour onward connection from there. On the subject, I've been very impressed by the buses so far in both Colombia and Ecuador, they're frequent, organised, fast, comfortable and cheap. They also often have a big screen TV at the front showing an action film. Turns out Liam Neeson's “I will find you, and I will kill you” speech from <em>Taken</em> is just as dramatic in Spanish. All this aside, an overnight bus was never going to give a decent night's sleep so it was a dream to arrive at our hostel to several cups of free coffee.
		</p>
		<img class="size-2" src="assets/images/20190430-01.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190430-01.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
		
		<p>Montañita beach is a long stretch of postcard white sand that provides a consistent beach break for good surf at high tide, with a reef at the north end that supposedly works through the tides on a larger swell. It's Ecuador's main surf break so the town has developed into a really vibrant backpackers’ haven, with all the cheap hostels, surfboard rental huts, western food and cocktails you could want. Our hostel was a recommendation from a Swedish girl we met on our rafting trip - a super-chilled place called Mamacucha. This was run by a larger-than-life character who called everyone “hermano” and introduced himself as <em>Colorado</em>. He bore a striking resemblance to a Spanish Chris O'Dowd and I really struggled for some reason to not keep calling him “Colombo”.
		</p>
		<img class="size-3" src="assets/images/20190430-02.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190430-02.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
		
		<p>Free coffee aside, the hostel had a great bar/common area to sit and relax, trade travelling stories with to the other guests and drink very cheap beer and mojitos. They also put on a fantastic all-you-can-eat empanada night where all the guests sat around a long table learning how to correctly fill and crimp the pastry (pasty making was good base knowledge) and eating the results over a few drinks.
		</p>
		<p>We spent a couple of days chilling on the beach and in the hostel, surfing in the later afternoon and into sunset. As the tide pushed in, all of the travellers and local heroes took to the water to form a crowded but friendly lineup. Charlotte, ever persistent in her surf progression, paddled out back at the perfect moment on our second day and we watched a pod of dolphins feeding whilst the brown pelicans swooped down to snatch the stray fish left behind. It's the closest I've been to dolphins (just a few metres) in probably 10 years!
		</p>
		<p>The food highlight in Montañita was unashamedly the local legend that is Ezzio's pizza, where they serve you a filling, fully loaded individual pizza for $3. Their joint is located on “cocktail alley”, where in the evening tens of cocktail stands open up on both sides of the street, offering a large plastic beaker of your chosen elixir for $3 flat, and they don't go easy on the measures!
		</p>
		<img class="size-3" src="assets/images/20190430-03.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190430-03.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
		
		<p>Whilst we were based in Montañita, we took a walk around the headland to the next town of Olón. This was labelled on the hostel map as 20 minutes but was more accurately 40 down the main road, with very little shade from the blistering equatorial sun. However, the rewards for the walk we're ample. Where Montañita had the people and the surf, Olón had the quiet, open, tranquil sands.
		</p>
		<img class="size-3" src="assets/images/20190430-04.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190430-04.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
		
		<img class="size-4" src="assets/images/20190430-05.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190430-05.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
		
		<p>It was mid-day when we got there and since we'd already learned the hard way to stay out of the sun during the middle of the day, we retreated into a local beachfront gaffe for a set <em>almuerzo</em>. This finally took the lead from the mountain lunch in Minka, Colombia as my best meal so far. Starter was a rich fish broth with some kind of local corn and yuka; main was lightly battered fried white fish with crisped plantain chips, rice and a red onion and tomato ceviche. It was absolutely spectacular at $3.50 with a glass of coke.
		</p>
		<p>After the sun moved a little past its peak we spent the afternoon sunbathing, swimming, and watching the wildlife. I already mentioned the brown pelicans; these are in abundance along the coast. They are majestic birds, with a wingspan nearing 2 metres and a penchant for gliding gracefully on the currents, just above the water's surface. Towards sunset they started fishing, which involved hovering to scout for fish, then launching into a vertical dive into the water. You could see the bulge in their low-hanging bills from a successful catch!
		</p>

		<p>There were also frigate birds in number circling the beach above, and on the sand were the fascinating sand bubbler crabs. These are the sort you watch and hear Sir David Attenborough narrating in your head, as they pop out of their holes, rolling tightly packed little balls of sand, which they carry away from their hole and disappear back down to dig further. Photography was difficult as even my most nimble footsteps in the sand sent them scuttling back to safety.
		</p>

		<p>With Ecuador's coast being on the West of the continent, both Montañita and Olón had beautiful evening light and fantastic sunsets. Pictures never do justice, but watching the sun melt into the horizon whilst the waves lapped the shore was truly blissful.

		<h2>Baños - Spanish for bathrooms</h2>
		<p>Baños - the town, not to be confused with the Spanish word for bathrooms - is 2 hours by bus south of Quito, following the snaking road down the mountainous backbone of Ecuador. Its name derives from the hot springs that flow from the base of the Tungurahua volcano, which looms over 5000m above.
		</p>
		<p>We arrived amid preparations for Semana Santa - Easter week - which meant that unlike most of our destinations so far, the town was absolutely teeming with people. This was the first time we found any difficulty in bagging a room at our first choice hostel, as Ecuadorians arrived from around the country to enjoy the quaint town with their families. The resulting atmosphere was buzzing, with the town centre partially pedestrianised and street magicians, circus performers and eager craft sellers vying for attention. We spent plenty of time meandering the streets and mooching around the various cafés, bars and shops including the “Stray Dog” brewpub which had some great dog art: 
		</p>
		<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190427-01.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
		
		<p>Baños markets itself as an outdoor adventure hub, and the rivers nearby offer really good white water rafting. The numerous tour operators offer some of the cheapest rates you'll find, so we opted to take a half day rafting trip. Rafting really makes the tubing in Mindo seem tame by comparison, though at least the rocks were to be avoided in this format!
		</p>
		<p>After the mandatory safety briefing from our instructor <em>Willy</em> and a dunk in the water to practice re-boarding, we set off for 90 minutes of level III and IV rapids. We managed pretty well with a 7-strong team of rafters under Willy's barked instruction, as he marshalled from the bow. We had a safety kayaker ahead at all times which was useful for the point at which one of our crew fell out mid-rapid (she was fine) and also to go on ahead and capture videos and photos. Check Charlotte's lasso technique in the video (she's sat up front, me directly behind) and Willy's air guitar in the photo below. He assured us this was after he'd deemed us competent and needed to do less hands-on paddling as a result.
		</p>

		<p>In the evening, after we'd dried off, we headed up to the <em>Casa de Árbol</em>, which is a treehouse with a large swing over the edge of the mountain peak - you may have seen it before on Instagram. The view was quite special, with cloud swirling slowly below into the valley. The swing photo was obligatory. To be fair, it was a good swing, as swings go. We also met a friendly dog who decided to force his way into our photos.
		</p>

		<p>Mountain bike outfitters also abound in Baños, so after a much needed down day (our first in 3 weeks, precipitated by heavy precipitation) we hired some wheels and set off South. This meant taking the main highway; great roads but shared with huge American 18-wheelers and buses. Fortunately, most drivers gave plenty of space as it's an established cycle route but there were a few hairy overtakes by oversized petrol tankers.
		</p>
		<p>After 18 km or so we came across what turned out to be a major Easter tourist attraction. If you've read my posts so far you guessed it right… a waterfall! Groups of Ecuadorian Holy week tourists had arrived by the bus load in vehicles called “Chivas”. These were mid-sized, open sided tour buses, painted in garish swathes of colour and fitted with oversized PA systems blasting <b>loud</b> music. We decided to join the queue into the waterfall viewpoint to be part of the experience and ended up following a narrow path to the water single file amongst hundreds of eager revellers, whilst street food vendors roasted plantain and grilled salchichas by the side of the thoroughfare. It was an impressive waterfall, but as you can see from the photo below it was just as notable for the crowds!
		</p>
		<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190427-06.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
		
		<p>After cycling a little further and lunch at a local café (and another cascada), we decided to bus back to Baños rather than re-tracing the highway for 20 km uphill. A bus isn't quite what we ended up on. In actuality we hopped in the back of a truck with the fading perfume of agricultural use whose driver was making a few quick bucks by loading up with weary cyclists. He had 2 wooden benches down the sides of the vehicle, similar to what you might sit on in a primary school assembly hall. The bikes were piled high across the tailgate. This made for a slightly uncomfortable, if highly memorable ride back as we stopped and crammed unexpected numbers of bikes in and bumped along on the way back into town.
		</p>
		<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190427-07.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
		
		<p>The cycle uphill into the winding mountain roads afterwards was definitely more pleasant than the return highway journey.

		<p>Having spent the day pedalling, we went for an evening soak in the thermal baths as the sun set behind the volcano. The peak of Tungurahua had remained elusive until this point due to clouds but as we were walking up to the baths it finally peeped through:
		</p>
		<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190427-10.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
		
		<p>The baths themselves were pleasant enough, with options spanning uncomfortably warm to probably-too-tepid. This was seemingly off the foreign tourist trail (a lot of the hotels have their own onsite baths) so we enjoyed feeling part of the local crowd whiling away the evening in matching obligatory swimming caps. Sadly I don't have a photo of us in these but I can therefore safely assure you they were highly fashionable knitwear (yes, fabric).
		</p>
		<p>Summary of this part of Ecuador: mountains (abundant, large), outdoor activities (varied, numerous), waterfalls (so many).

		<h2>Don't go chasing waterfalls - Mindo</h2>
		
		<p>A 3 hour bus from northern Quito took us into the “Cloud forest” town of Mindo. Whilst numerous tour agencies lined the main <em>Avenue de Quito</em>, it had a distinctly sleepy and rural feel to it which was a welcome change from bustling Quito. By contrast, there are a number of traveller-targeted activities on offer in the surrounding area.</p>
		
		<img class="lazy size-1" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190424-00.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
		
		<p>On our first afternoon we went “tubing” down the river Mindo. This involved hurtling downstream on 5 tractor-sized inner tubes bound together with rope as our guide (captain?) Juan Carlos jumped in and out of the water in his tracksuit and trainers, kicking us off of and onto rocks; these seemed to be seen as a feature, not an obstacle. Juan Carlos was a man of many scars - including a possible gunshot scar on his arm - and few words. His safety briefing consisted of “hold onto the ropes”. The river itself was achingly beautiful, gushing white over the boulders and flanked on either side by draping dense, green jungle foliage. Whilst holding onto the ropes for dear life I wasn't able to capture any pictures, but we did walk back upstream to grab a photo, after the ride back into town stood in the tube raft strapped to the back of the pickup truck.</p>

		<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190424-02.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
		
		<p>In the evening we went on a tour of a local chocolate farm called <em>El Quetzal.</em> It's honestly the most delicious dark chocolate I've ever eaten - I'm normally a luddite preferring the milky sweet variety. Sergio, our Portuguese guide, explained to us soup-to-nuts how they make chocolate, which is quite an involved process.</p>
		
		<ul>
		<li>First, they take the cacao fruit and extract the juicy white beans, which they ferment in their own pulp to enhance the sweet flavour, before drying them for 21 days in a greenhouse.</li>
		<li>Once dry, they are roasted for 30 minutes before being crushed to remove the cocoa nibs from the hard husks.</li>
		<li>These are separated using a hand-built machine akin to a wind-tunnel which blows the light shells aside from the heavier nibs, which fall through the airflow.</li>
		<li>The nibs can either be pressed at a pressure of 30 tonnes (using a car jack!) to separate cocoa butter from from pure cocoa for cooking, or spun and stirred for 12 hours in a hot room at 35°C to produce smooth, molten chocolate.</li>
		<li>This chocolate is tempered in a cold room at 17°C and poured into moulds to create chocolate bars that they only sell on-site.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190424-03.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
		
		<p>The only addition to the raw chocolate is cane sugar (33% maximum, 15% minimum), save for their macadamia, chili, coffee or ginger flavoured bars. All of these ingredients are also grown on-site. Having tasted large quantities all of them (as well as their brownies, cacao syrup, ginger syrup, and cacao BBQ sauce) I can confirm they are all equally spectacular. The following dinner was not, by necessity, a large meal.</p>
		
		<p><b>Fun fact:</b> Apparently, there is some concern for the longevity of the cacao plant, which has incredibly small flowers, and so is pollinated by microscopic midges that only live in equatorial regions. This means it can't be cultivated in a greenhouse since no-one has yet worked out a way to artificially pollinate it.</p>

		<p>The next day we hiked up into the forest to burn off some chocolate. We stopped off to go zip-lining over the canopy, which was a spectacular way of seeing the jungle in all its glory:</p>

		<p>We walked on up from there to take a cable car of sorts (more accurately, a metal crate on a cable attached to a petrol engine) across the valley to the neighbouring peak. This gave us access to a jungle walk via of 5 of the 7 Mindo waterfalls. You'll note South America seems to have a very high waterfall-per-capita ratio if you've read all my posts so far…</p>
		
		<p>2 of these <em>Cascadas</em> fell into deep pools that conspired with the humidity to make for a very inviting swim. The last, which was only accessible by wading through the river of the former, provided a beautiful spot for an avocado lunch. Side note - I'm trying to eat as many avocados as possible in South America, they're <b>SO</b> much better than what we import into the UK.</p>

		<p>On our final day we got up before sunrise to go bird-watching with a local guide called Irman. We spotted 44 of the 330 bird species that inhabit Mindo, including 2 varieties of toucans, 3 varieties of parrot, and a massive swallow-tailed kite. The “shiny cowbird?” was another highlight for the name alone. The toucans were the most spectacular spot, as you get a really grand reveal when they turn their beaks into profile. Short of a telephoto lens, you'll have the play “spot the parrot” in the photo below taken through Irman's birding scope.</p>

		<p>Not content with winged feathered vertebrates, we also visited a butterfly farm, where highlights included the “owl eye” butterfly. These tame fellas proved very willing for a selfie with the aid of some banana to eat from the end of my finger. The <em>Blue Morpho</em> variety was significantly more elusive - below is my best attempt.</p>

		<p>Our 3 days in Mindo were well-balanced with activities in the morning into early afternoon and downtime later in the day as the daily heavy downpour arrived. I'm not entirely convinced by the difference between a cloud forest and a rainforest…</p>

		<h2>Cotopaxi - short blog, tall volcano</h2>
		
		<p>Whilst we were still based in Quito we took a day trip to the Cotopaxi national park to ascend the 5,897m Cotopaxi volcano. Not possessing the gear for the additional 6 hour ice climb to the summit, we settled for hiking to the base of the glacier (past the refuge at 4,864m) at 5,000m.</p>
		
		<p>Our bus ride to the park gave little hope of a view as we drove within the thick cloud layer and rain buffeted the windows. Our guide was far from optimistic about the view but gave us a good overview of the bird life we were supposed to watch out for whilst we had nothing else to look at. The prize spot the mighty condor, but he warned that there are also “Caracara” birds that look very similar but are much smaller. He tickled me with his description of perceiving small caracara versus far away condors for how closely it mirrored Father Ted’s <a href="https://youtu.be/MMiKyfd6hA0">"small and far away"</a> cows scene.</p>
		
		<p>Miraculously, as we were getting stuck into our ascent - and lamenting not having brought waterproof trousers - the weather gods relented and the cloud began to clear. As we reached the glacier we began to get a glimpse towards the summit as the clouds circled like a halo around the crest. The glacier itself was quite a sight, presenting a barren, jagged and alien landscape.</p>
		
		<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190422-01.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
		
		<p>We mountain-biked down to the lake at the base of the supervolcano (which was by far the fastest mode of transportation), and found the cloud had cleared even more to give a really spectacular vista of the peak. The picture below doesn't even get close to giving an idea of how immense Cotopaxi is in real life.</p>
		
		<img class="lazy size-4" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190422-02.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
		
		<p>One of the most striking things in the national park for me was that the tree line in Ecuador is at around 4,000m - in Europe we don't have mountains that tall in any case, but trees wouldn't grow much above 2,200m in the Swiss alps.<a href="https://www.webcitation.org/5yfLc2eTn?url=http://pages.unibas.ch/botschoen/treeline_elevation/index.shtml/">[1]</a> The frequently dotted warning siren stations were also a visible reminder that the volcano is already a few years past its expected next eruption date since it supposedly follows a 100-year cycle. Our guide’s advice if the sirens started - “call your mamas and tell them you love them”.</p>
		
		<p>Spoiler alert, we survived. Next stop on the road is the Mindo cloud forest.</p>

		<h2>Ecuador - a story of Ponchos and Dollars</h2>
		<h3>Otavalo and Quito</h3>
		
		<p>So we're already onto our second country - Ecuador! Everyone we've met along the way so far is incredulous that we spent just over a week in Colombia, which is a fair challenge. It's a beautiful country and I definitely want to go back to see more.</p>
		
		<p>On the plus side, Ecuador is absolutely stunning. First stop across the border (the crossing of which took an uncomfortable 6 hours) was the market town of Otavalo.</p>
		
		<p>Otavalo is nestled in the sweeping lush green mountains of northern Ecuador, where neighbouring villagers are known for crafting textiles and leather goods. Its <em>Plaza de los Ponchos</em> provides the centrepoint for the market trade of these and many other colourful goods. We went on a Wednesday; supposedly the second busiest day after Saturday. I honestly can't imagine how they would fit more stalls in the square, which was a densely woven warren of blankets, knitwear and yes, ponchos.</p>
		
		<p>We resisted the urge for unnecessary purchases, despite a keen market trader making many offers to me for an alpaca sweater to keep me warm in the 28 degree heat.</p>
		
		<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190417-01.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
		
		<p>After the market, we took ourselves on a hike into the hills above the town, where we visited the “Arbol Milenio”, a 100-year-old tree perched atop a stunning viewpoint. A word on the weather in Ecuador so far… variable. From the viewpoint we had thunder and deeply threatening clouds in the valley to one side and sunshine to the other. This made for rather spectacular lighting for the stately tree:</p>

		<img class="lazy size-4" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190417-03.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
		
		<p>We walked on to a hilltop condor sanctuary that had (as well as condors) a bewildering parliament of owls of all shapes, sizes and varieties. The final stop before we walked back to the town was a spectacular waterfall called “Cascadas de Peguche”. I got incredibly wet posing for the photo below as my windmilling arms signalling “hurry up” were misinterpreted by Charlotte as “keep going”.</p>
		
		<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190417-04.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
		
		<p>Next stop south was Ecuador's capital, Quito. Our main activity was to take a walking tour around the picturesque old town. We had a fantastic guide called Etiel who had the perfect combination of both knowledge and passion about his country and the city. We learned more about the history and politics of Ecuador and Quito than I could recount in short form here, but fun facts included:
		<ul>
		<li>Quito has <em>200</em> churches - the Spanish built one on top of every Incan temple they came across</li>
		<li>Ecuador exports 30% of the world's bananas</li>
		<li>Despite this, it's biggest export is oil</li>
		<li>Its second biggest source of income remains money sent home from abroad following mass immigration during their last economic crisis</li>
		<li>This crisis led to the demise of the Sucre, Ecuador's former currency - they have used the US dollar since the year 2000</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		
		<p>A little more on that last one. The Sucre experienced such massive inflation as the country lost faith in their currency that against the dollar it fell from an original value of 5 gradually to 7,000, then finally in its last months to a tragic low of 25,000 before formal “dollarisation”. Though the dollar had already been used informally for some time, the way it was adopted was hugely unpopular. The president who proposed it was ousted with some veracity, only for the subsequent president to go ahead with the plan anyway. It did have the unexpected result of making a large improvement over time to the Ecuadorian economy, but due to the point at which it was brought in - after mass inflation - it now makes imports into Ecuador very expensive. The country also struggles to control its fiscal policy, since they cannot print their own notes. They do have a limited ability to mint their own coins, but paying for anything with a 20$ note often involves the shopkeeper running next door to try to scrabble together change, such is the issue with availability of low value denominations.</p>

		<p>Overall Quito Ecuador so far gives the impression of relative affluence compared to Colombia (its public infrastructure is also fantastic), until you dig a little deeper into its economy.</p>
		
		<p>Coming up - the Cotopaxi volcano and the cloud forest town of Mindo. Stay tuned!</p>

		<h2><em>Blog</em>otá, Pasto, Laguna La Cocha*</h2>
		
		<p>We landed back into Bogotá from the coast to spend a few days exploring Colombia's capital. It's a dynamic city that feels very progressive and every bit the modern capital. We stayed in the Candelaria district in the heart of the old town, which by contrast retains a lot of Spanish colonial architecture juxtaposed with constantly changing street art.</p>
		
		<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190411-01.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
		
		<p>On the Friday and Saturday nights the area was alive with street performers, musicians and lots of young Colombians (Candelaria is in close proximity to the university district) gathering to meet and socialise. It was a really great atmosphere to soak up.</p>
		
		<p>On our first day we took the funicular railway to the peak of Montserate, one of the 2 mountains that loom high over the city. From the summit at 3200m there are fantastic views over the city, in spite of the haze of pollution that masks much of the detail. We stopped in a cafe before heading down and had a “Chocolate Santafereño” - an odd local delicacy of corn bread, soft cheese and hot chocolate. Not altogether unpleasant but I probably won't have another.</p>
		
		<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190411-02.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
		
		<img class="lazy size-1" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190411-03.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
		
		<p>The next day we joined a bicycle tour; Bogota is surprisingly bike friendly - on Sundays they even close some highways for a massive cyclathon. We took in a lot of politically motivated street art - the current president is widely despised - as well as some state-sponsored murals and visited an incredible fruit market called “Paloquemao”, where we sampled more fruits I can't name than I could shake a banana at. We also played <em>Tejo</em>. </p>
		
		<p>Tejo is Colombia's national sport, which is played by hurling large metal weights at packets of gunpowder arranged in a circle on a clay target. If you cause an explosion, you score a point! It is unsurprisingly <b>very loud</b>. You don't pay to play Tejo, you buy a crate of beer and Tejo occurs whilst drinking it. It's a sport I can really get on board with.</p>
		
		<img class="lazy size-1" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190411-05.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
		
		<p>Our last tourist stop was the gold museum. As stupid as it sounds, I was surprised by just how much gold they have.</p>
		
		<p>Despite the masses of gold and silver that were unceremoniously plundered by the Spanish conquistadors, the museum has an enormous collection of ornate pieces that go a long way to explaining the habits, culture, life and death of pre-colonial Latin American people. This is observed in, for example, the way they decorated and revered Shamans (holy men) as bird-men in extravagant gold jewellery, and in sculpted scenes depicting topics such as birth, death, farming and fishing. Overall a very interesting (and shiny) exhibition.</p>
		
		<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190411-04.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
		
		<p>On our way south to the Colombia-Ecuador border, we stopped off in the town of Pasto. Not much to mentioned in Pasto itself other than our French host's restaurant recommendation of “Mister Pollo” which, aside from fried chicken, served a surprisingly delicious battered broccoli.</p>
		
		<p>From Pasto we took a day trip by local bus to the second largest lake in Colombia - Laguna La Cocha. It rained. A lot. We did have a nice hike between lakeside towns regardless, had a freshly caught rainbow trout (trucha) lunch, and got a great moody grey photo of the lake, which was stunning even in the rain.</p>

		<h2>Go Charlotte, it's your birthday</h2>
		
		<p>The 3rd April was Charlotte's 30th birthday. Shout out to everyone who sent cards (and bunting) with me for the trip - it made for a great birthday morning:</p>
		
		<img class="lazy size-1" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190407-01.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
		
		<p>We headed up into the mountains of the Sierra Nevada into the jungle town of Minca the night before to stay in an “Ecohab” - picture below for context - as a birthday treat. It was absolutely stunning, with sweeping views across the luscious green jungle and hummingbirds flitting around the hammocks on our balcony.</p>
		
		<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190407-02.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
		
		<p>After cards and presents, we set off on a motorbike tour of the surrounding area. First stop was the Pozo Azul waterfall, where it seemed that most of Colombia (but no other foreigners) had had the same idea to take a dip in the cool, if not actually blue, water to beat the heat.</p>
		
		<p>Next up was La Victoria coffee plantation. If I'm honest, I'd never given much thought to how coffee is produced so the tour of the facility was fascinating. La Victoria was started by a few engineers from Europe who had come to Santa Marta to build the railway there. They planted an objectively large crop of coffee plants and so - as engineers would - set about building bespoke machinery to process the coffee from fruit to dried bean ready for export. The entire process is powered by the naturally cascading mountain water, which is channelled to drive beans through pipes that transport and sort them by quality as well as turning water wheels that move the machinery. To this day they use the original equipment so the entire place looks like a working museum.</p>
		
		<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190407-03.jpeg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
		
		<p>Interestingly, due to the many stages in the trade and production of coffee, La Victoria have zero visibility of where their product ends up, save for the very small amount that they roast and grind on site, which was truly delicious.</p>
		
		<p>After riding up to a viewpoint where we sampled the local “puma rosa” fruit that our guides knocked down from a nearby tree, we joined them for an authentic Colombian lunch. This was served at an establishment that I honestly think might just have been a local woman's kitchen. It consisted of a delicious meat and lentil soup followed by spiced grilled pork with beans, rice and potatoes with a fruit drink; all for the princely sum of 10,000 pesos (around £2.40 at the time of writing). It is still <b>by far</b> the best meal I've eaten on our trip.</p>
		
		<p>On the way back down we stopped briefly at a hostel with giant hammocks and another cracking view (and beer) before stopping at our second, much more idyllic waterfall for another swim.</p>
		
		<img class="lazy size-4" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190407-04.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">

		<img class="lazy size-4" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190407-07.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
		
		<p>The ride back into Minca would have been uneventful since we'd gotten used to the undulating and unforgiving dirt track roads by this point. This was up until the point we ground to a startling halt in front of a 3ft snake in the middle of the road. He signalled to wait until it had moved off before we should attempt to pass. When I asked him what type of snake it was, he was only able to confirm vehemently that it was <em>“peligroso”</em> -  dangerous.</p>
		
		<p>In the evening we retired to our idyllic lodgings to watch the sunset and the birds. Needless to say our standard of accommodation can only go down from here…</p>

		<h2>Bienvenido a Colombia</h2>
		
		<p>So we've arrived in South America! Specifically, Bogotá El Dorado international airport, Colombia, on Saturday afternoon. Given the 4am start in the UK and the 14hrs of travel, we very much crashed out on arrival!</p>
		
		<p>The following morning we began proper, hopping on another flight to Santa Marta on the Caribbean coast. We stayed in an incredibly chilled out hostel called The Dreamer, which caters to backpackers who want sun, a pool and beer served all day and night...</p>
		
		<img class="lazy size-1" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190403-01.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
		
		<p>Our first afternoon there we bussed into town. Bus drivers in Colombia are masters of multitasking - simultaneously weaving through traffic, collecting fares, distributing change, paying the bloke washing the windscreen and buying bottled water through the cab window. From the seat behind, Charlotte's job was to pass change to those retreating for seats to avoid being knocked for 6 by the next gear change.</p>
		
		<p>The beach front of Santa Marta is somewhat blighted by the enormous shipping port in the backdrop, but was a great place to people-watch with a cold drink and turn down various offers of “sunglasses” - every vendor seemed to have only 1 sunglasses case which was filled with drugs - and to absorb the colour and the Latin music blaring from every taverna and street seller. The old town had an air of its colonial past (nice basilica, pictured below) but felt weathered by tourism. Santa Marta is where the Colombians come to holiday.</p>

		<img class="lazy size-1" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190403-03.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
		
		<p>The next day we headed for the Tayrona national park to see some less commercialised  coast reached through the jungle. The park is massive - our hike in from the entry gate was one of the shorter routes available at a humid 2 hours, after which the cool water of the sea and lunch of fresh avocado really took the edge off.</p>
		
		<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190403-04.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
		
		<p>On the trek back we met up with a couple of Canadians who we'd met on the morning and hit Attenborough mode; we clocked an Agouti (think 2ft-long guinea pig - bugger to photograph), some woodpeckers and 3 different varieties of monkey (which the Canadians were super excited about). You can play spot the monkey on the photo below!</p>

		<h2>29th March 2019 - So it begins…</h2>
		<p>I'm writing this first post from the train to Kew Gardens - not technically a stop on the travel route yet, but a useful place to stay overnight to be near to Heathrow for tomorrow's 07:35 to Bogotá (thanks Lucy for the bed!).</p>
		
		<p>Today Charlotte and I both finished work for the next 6 months. I've handed in my work pass and laptop and it's finally hit home that we're leaving. I'll remember this day for the Evening Standard headline that greeted me on the way out of the tube at Moorgate, pictured below.</p>
		
		<p>That is the first and last reference I will make to the B word in this blog series.</p>
		
		<p>So first stop, Colombia! We're on the way, it's finally happening. The next post here will be coming at you from South America. Stay tuned!</p>
