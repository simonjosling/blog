			<p>On the 30th March 2019, Charlotte and I set off travelling around the world for 6 months, taking a break from work, experiencing new cultures and visiting a lot of places we've wanted to go to for a long time.</p>
			<p>I'll be endeavouring to write a weekly blog here with a brief update as to what we've been doing and where we've been - hopefully with some pictures.</p>
			<p>For anyone that's interested, this will hopefully give you a way of keeping up with what we're up to and it will force me to regularly pen [type] something to remember the trip by afterwards.</p>
			<p>I thank Charlotte in advance for putting up with the hours I'll likely spend writing and re-writing this and the time spent trying to make the website code do what I want it to!</p>

			<h2>"One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster"</h2>
			
			<p>We returned to Bangkok from the islands on the 11 hour boat and bus service, arriving late in the evening with the sun down and the city already into the bustle of Friday night.
			</p>
			<p>Whilst Charlotte wasn't feeling well and went straight to bed, I was predictably hungry. So, I hit the streets in search of local grub. Settling myself in at a street-side stall, I ordered a creamy plate of masaman curry and rice for about £1.50 and ate it whilst taking in the sights and sounds of the city.
			</p>
			
			<img class="size-2" src="assets/images/20190721-01.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190721-01.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>We were staying in the <em>Khao San road</em> area, which meant there was plenty to watch. We ventured to the namesake road on a subsequent night and found a street <b>packed</b> with tourists, with hawkers offering buckets of cocktails at rock-bottom prices. Had we been away from home for the first time aged 18 I can imagine this being candy-land. As it is, we've aged and done our fair share of partying so we quickly left Khao San behind for somewhere more authentic.
			</p>
			<p>The area I sat down in for the curry that first night was fortunately the latter. I found myself surrounded by a healthy mix of locals out for a bite to eat - most Bangkok residents prefer to eat out as I understand it, hence the cheap prices - and tourists like me trying to join in!
			</p>
			<p>We spent a full day in the capital visiting the <em>Grand Palace</em> and <em>Wat Pho</em> to get our fill of Thai temples.
			</p>
			
			<img class="size-3" src="assets/images/20190721-02.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190721-02.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">

			<p>The palace was undoubtedly grand and had many exquisite examples of Thai architecture from different periods, including the temple of the revered <em>Emerald Buddha</em>. This figure has been prized by Thai royalty for centuries and has moved around the country with the changing location of the royal capital. That being said, I actually preferred the second site. This had fewer crowds and tour groups and was home to a <b>46m long by 15m tall</b> "Reclining Buddha". This was truly staggering and nigh on impossible to view all at once since they built a quite confining chapel around it. The whole structure is covered in gold leaf and he has the most ornate feet (a strange adjective for feet I'll concede) which are inlaid with mother of pearl.
			</p>
			
			<img class="size-2" src="assets/images/20190721-04.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190721-04.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">

			<p>The remainder of the buildings at this temple site featured <em>many, many</em> more Buddhas - mostly golden - in various positions, scales and settings.
			</p>
			<img class="size-2" src="assets/images/20190721-07.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190721-07.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">

			<p>Since we were in town on the weekend we also visited the <em>Chatuchak</em> weekend market, which is an event of epic proportions that sells everything you could possibly conceive of being able to purchase. This gave us the authentic Asian market experience since tourists were certainly not the target market here.
			</p>
			
			<img class="size-2" src="assets/images/20190721-11.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190721-11.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>That day I really put my digestive system to the test… Lunch at the market was papaya salad with salted soft-shell crab and whole baby shrimp to crunch through. Papaya salad is a common Thai dish composed of vegetables and buyer's choice of meat/fish drenched in a sweet and fiery liquid. Delicious.
			</p>
			<img class="size-2" src="assets/images/20190721-12.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190721-12.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>Dinner's assault on my gut was "fish ball noodle soup" from a random street stall in Chinatown. The lights, smells, traffic and utter chaos of Chinatown were well worth the visit, especially after we'd primed ourselves with fancy cocktails from nearby <em>Tep Bar</em>, concocted from Thai rum and spices.
			</p>
			<img class="size-1" src="assets/images/20190721-13.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190721-13.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">

			<p>Fortunately, my stomach held out and provided no barrier to our onward journey North to one of Thailand's national parks in search of elephants... Stay tuned!

			<h2>On an Island in the Sun</h2>
			
			<p>So it's been a pretty amazing, happy start to the second leg of our travels; but I'll get to that in a little while…
			</p>
			<p>After a week recharging in the UK wherein we managed to see both our families, attend 2 weddings, see a cricket match and consume my own body weight in cheese, we set off for Thailand.
			</p>
			<p>Our turbulent flight from London Heathrow to Bangkok Suvarnabhumi left us reeling from lack of sleep and on a compounding 6 hour time difference. Knowing that our first real stop in Thailand was the South-Eastern islands a further overnight bus away, we decided to further punish our bodies by doing this on the day of arrival. We finally reached the island of <em>Koh Tao</em> wearied but with the prospect of recovering in the dappled shade of the palm trees along <em>Sairee</em> beach.
			</p>
			<img class="size-2" src="assets/images/20190717-01.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190717-01.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>Having arrived without any major delays, we checked into our dive school - <em>Scuba Junction</em> - with a couple of days spare enjoying the aquamarine water and the white sands (and swotting up on our PADI diving theory).
			</p>
			<img class="size-2" src="assets/images/20190717-02.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190717-02.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			<img class="size-3" src="assets/images/20190717-03.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190717-03.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			<img class="size-1" src="assets/images/20190717-04.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190717-04.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>Our diving course started with training on how to assemble, test and disassemble our buoyancy and air supply gear, followed by our first "confined water" dives in the swimming pool. Here we practiced basic buoyancy control techniques and necessary skills such as flooding and clearing our masks underwater, changing to emergency air supplies and swimming tests.
			</p>
			<p>We also rehearsed the underwater sign language we'd need, resulting in a few beer fines for me whilst I fought my every instinct to signal "thumbs up" (which means ascend to the surface) and replace it with "ok". We settled the beer fines that evening with a few drinks with our instructor "Chips" and the "Divemaster" trainees who were to be our shipmates on the following dives.
			</p>
			<img class="size-1" src="assets/images/20190717-05.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190717-05.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			<img class="size-2" src="assets/images/20190717-06.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190717-06.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>The next 2 days we got out on the early boat leaving at 06:15 to do 4 "open water" dives, to be assessed on our skills and to learn how to use compases and dive computers (which give you a continuous readout of how deep you are and how long you can safely stay down).
			</p>
			<img class="size-1" src="assets/images/20190717-07.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190717-07.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			<img class="size-2" src="assets/images/20190717-08.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190717-08.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>By the second day we'd completed the majority of our skills so our dives became more focussed on enjoying the - quite amazing - shoales of tropical fish and spotting turtles and stingrays. By the end of the course we were enjoying ourselves enough that we decided to head out the following day to do 2 further dives - to get certified down to 30 metres (the base course gets you to 18m) and to dive a wrecked battleship.
			</p>
			<p>The first deep dive was a new experience as the visibility for a stretch was extremely low and we had to stay close together just to remain in sight of one another. It was also much colder and was an overall uncomfortable, disorientating experience. Our second dive couldn't have been more different. The visibility was amazing - we could see the wreck from the surface, 20 metres below! Wreck diving was everything I had hoped diving would be and more. The ship was largely intact and complete with massive gun turrets, and the fish living and swimming around it were big, vibrant and in <b>huge</b> number.
			</p>
			<img class="size-2" src="assets/images/20190717-09.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190717-09.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>I was finally able to take my GoPro camera down on this dive, as on the PADI course they don't allow photography - with good reason; the last thing you need when you're re-learning how to breathe is to be concentrating on whether the red light is blinking…
			</p>
			<p>I was really pleased with the photos and videos that came out and it was awesome to be able to get a small snapshot of what we experienced while we were down there.

			<p>The food on Koh Tao was incredible. Every humble Thai street stall cooking fresh noodles is a culinary delight; the highlights included a blindingly hot red fish curry, and simple but delicious stir-fried chicken with garlic and ginger.
			</p>
			<p>After our last dives, we hopped straight on a boat bound for the neighbouring island of <em>Koh Samui</em>. Here we stayed a night at an incredible 5-star resort called <em>Santiburi</em> that Charlotte's sister Amelia arranged as a 30th Birthday present for her. Having called the hotel a number of times - "Oh you are Charlotte? Your sister…!" - they had laid on a birthday cake for our arrival, which we ate on our terrace outside the <b>massive</b> villa we had beside the beach.
			</p>
			<img class="size-1" src="assets/images/20190717-14.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190717-14.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">

			<p>We whiled away the day on the luxurious sunloungers overlooking the "tropical paradise postcard" beach with romantic dips in the beautifully cool-yet-warm water. We interspersed this with a swim in one of the largest swimming pools I've ever seen.
			</p>
			<img class="size-2" src="assets/images/20190717-15.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190717-15.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">

			<p>As the sun set across the water we had some delicious cocktails at the beach-side bar before retreating to our vast bathroom to doll up for dinner. After such a blissful day, I decided the time was right to ask Charlotte to marry me. Without going into the details, I got down on one knee in our "living room" (she said yes) before we went to the beachfront restaurant to celebrate with a gourmet seafood dinner and a bottle of champagne. Needless to say this was a departure from our usual travelling style (and bugdet!).
			</p>
			<img class="size-2" src="assets/images/20190717-17.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190717-17.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>We spent the following day making the most of the hotel's facilities before checking into a neighbouring (cheaper) resort to stay another couple of days enjoying paradise and gradually spreading the news and our excitement.
			</p>
			<p>So as I said, a pretty fantastic start to the second leg of our travels… and the rest of our life together :-)

		<h2>Each one she passed goes "-ah"</h2>
		
		<p>In Brazil, they speak Portuguese. Whilst I was aware of this before we set off round the world, I'd been concentrating so hard on Spanish for Colombia through Argentina that I'd completely failed to prepare for this language. We arrived into the country knowing only <em>obrigado</em> for thank you. There were enough shared words with Spanish to give me hope but few enough that I had no clue what anyone was saying.
		</p>
		<p>On the plus side, as we landed into Rio de Janeiro It became immediately obvious that English was a well-spoken second language amongst many residents of the developed city. 
		</p>
		<p>A little more on the landing. We flew into the Santos Dumont airport which lies on the waterside not a great distance from the centre of the city. The runway is bordered by water on 3 sides and because of its proximity to the city, the view when you land is unbelievable. The tip of the wing must have practically brushed the nose of old <em>Christ the Redeemer</em> on the way past, such was the close-up we had out of the window. We later established landing into this airport was on many people's "top 10" lists of activities in Rio… Unfortunately, since we didn't know that ahead of time, I don't have any photos!
		</p>
		<p>We stayed in the well-to-do <em>Ipanema</em> district - yes, like "the girl from" - a short walk from both Ipanema and Copacabana beaches. Rio manages to have all the high rise of a modern capital city crammed right up to the edge of the land, with huge - if slightly garish - white high-rise hotels lining the waterfront. The sand in Rio is so fine and white that I had to research it to satisfy my curiosity that it is natural and not imported from elsewhere!
		</p>
		<img class="size-4" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190710-01.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
		
		<p>We had an apartment with cooking facilities which helped take the sting out of the price of eating - Rio is <b>expensive</b>. I thought I'd teach myself to make caipirinhas in the same vein so that we could drink in the proper Brazilian way in the apartment. I never did quite get the ratios right and seemed to get through the bottle of cachaça quite quickly and in a slight daze.
		</p>
		<img class="size-1" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190710-02.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
		
		<p>Our sightseeing tour of Rio included the Sugar loaf mountain, from which the view over the city helps give a sense of just how big the place is and how high the <em>favelas</em> spill into the mountains. We went up on the cable car just before sunset which meant we got to see the change from day to night as the city's lights came on.

		<p>To celebrate my birthday we got tickets to go see Bolivia vs Peru at the famous <em>Maracanã</em> stadium. Whilst the stadium was far from full due to the Brazil match taking place later that evening, the Peruvian fans were unbelievably loud and cheered their team on to a strong victory. Afterwards, we found that the wine bar near our apartment had transformed the street into a huge party so we joined in. I chatted to some locals to find out if this was football related or not and it turns out this was just your average Rio Tuesday night…

		<p>On my birthday itself, we took the antique streetcar up to the <em>Santa Teresa</em> district for a hearty lunch of <em>feijoada</em> - beef and bean stew. The area retains a lot of Rio's old charm which has largely been concreted over by modern development.
		</p>
		<img class="size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190710-11.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">

		<p>Our walking tour guide (we always have to take a walking tour, much to Charlotte's eye rolling) described to us how Rio has been poor at preserving its history over the years, with new built directly on top of old. He showed us a good example of this where more recently the facade of an old building had been preserved, but with a tower block built directly behind it!
		</p>
		<img class="size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190710-14.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
		
		<p>He also made me realise that I knew little to nothing about the Portuguese empire, which I'll now butcher the history of…
		</p>
		<p>During our tour of <em>Plaza XV</em> our guide explained that while Napoleon was doing his thing in Europe, he threatened to invade Portugal unless they sided with France. This left the inexperienced King João VI in a sticky situation since Portugal had very close ties with Britain, who famously weren't that keen on old Bonaparte. The British stationed a few of the mighty Royal Navy's finest ships off the coast of Portugal to remind John the consequences of betrayal in a "rock and hard place" sort of move. João's solution was to bugger off to Brazil - already a Portuguese colony - with 16,000 of his people and rule from there. This all happened in such a rush that the Brazilian 'royal palace' in Plaza XV was converted from a municipal building and so isn't the grandest palace you'll see.
		</p>
		<img class="size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190710-15.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
		
		<p>When he returned to Portugal nearly 2 decades later, Brazil was no longer a colony but a recognised nation. So, João left his son Pedro to sit as Prince Regent of Brazil. Over the coming years Portugal changed the rules as constitutionalism took hold. Brazil, fearing a return to colony status, declared independence with Pedro as it's first Emperor. When João died he'd been Emperor for 10 years and doing a bad job of it. Taking a leaf out of his Dad's book he ran away from the problem, returning to Portugal to take the throne there and leaving his 5-year-old son to become the second Emperor of Brazil. By the age of 14 the kid was actually doing a pretty good job. He was widely liked up until the point where the Brazilians declared themselves a republic in 1888 and threw him out. This was in large part driven by a newly enacted law ending slavery that was widely unwelcome amongst the farming communities. Whilst part of the "United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves" over <b>950 thousand</b> African slaves were brought to Brazil, and the ethnic mix of modern Rio is testament to that large change in demographic.
		</p>
		<p>So Rio brought us to the end of our time in South America and roughly to the mid-point in our great adventure. On the flight back to the UK we reflected on what a fantastic first 3 months this has been. If you ever get the chance to take a sabbatical or extended time off between jobs, I'd highly recommend this not-working, nomadic thing. It's really great.

			<h2>Don't go chasing waterfalls - part II</h2>
			<h3>Iguazú Falls</h3>
			
			<p>Oh my word I took a lot of photos.
			</p>
			<p>That was my overriding takeaway from the <em>Iguazú Falls</em> - or at least it was when I came to write this blog and had the mammoth task of sifting through endless snaps from different angles, viewpoints and distances.
			</p>
			<p>This wonder of the world is actually a series of around 180 waterfalls marking a section of the border between Argentina and Brazil, a stone's throw from the tri-border point between Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay.
			</p>
			<p>On arrival into the town of <em>Puerto Iguazú</em> we went to watch a gorgeous sun set at this border point over the river before dinner at a local Mexican joint. It served great caipirinhas and unnecessary after-dinner tequila shots that at least got us off to sleep early in preparation for our first big day at the falls. Puerto Iguazú was very pleasant for a border town, and catered to tourists crossing over from Brazil. The local market tavern <em>"Gaucho's"</em> served us one final fantastic steak before we left Argentina.
			</p>

			<p>As much as it sounds like overkill, the falls are a sight that easily warrants a full day and a half of visiting. The Argentinian <em>parque nacional de Iguazú</em> has a number of walking trails with close-up viewpoints of sections of the falls, where the Brazilian <em>parque nacional <b>do Iguacu</b></em> has the far-away panoramas that give a sense of the vast scale.
			</p>
			<p>The common question is therefore, which side is more impressive? I've not come to a good conclusion on that. Visiting the Argentinian side first, I was completely dumbfounded by the amount of water flowing over the <em>Garganta del Diablo</em> - Devil's Throat - and how close we could get to it. By contrast, even after a full day's exploration up close, the sweeping view from Brazil gave a new perspective of how enormous the whole formation is. It's nearly impossible to photograph the falls all at once but this was my best shot at it.

			<p>On our first day, we got <b>very wet</b>. Several times. The first of these was completely premeditated. On the sound advice of some Brits we'd met in Sucre, we took a boat ride upriver to see the falls from below. They didn't pull any punches in taking us up to and under the falling water, to the point where it was impossible to keep eyes open until the boat had retreated. They also took an agressive line over the river rapids, sending us airborne on the outward and return journeys for good measure.
			</p>
			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190703-08.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			<img class="lazy size-1" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190703-09.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>The boat was accessed via a dirt-track ride through the Atlantic Jungle of the national park, where a guide with a microphone did her best to convince us we might see all sorts of wildlife that showed no evidence of residing nearby. What we <em>did</em> see later in the day were many, many tame <em>coati</em> looking for scraps of food, and an abundance of wildly patterned butterflies.
			</p>

			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190703-11.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>The second time we got wet was at the Devil's Throat. The viewing platform was surprisingly close to the water but at river-level above. I had assumed we'd get a bit of spray but broadly expected the water to fall down and stay down given the 100+ metre drop. I was very wrong. With 2800 litres of water going over <b>every second</b> that day, more than once the rebounding, pluming water came all the way back up again and rained down on us in a torrent.

			<p>As we crossed the border on a local bus bound for national park #2 I was ready to be disappointed, but we still spent a very enjoyable half day continuing to be mesmerised by moving water. Honestly I could watch it all day. We also got soaked all over again at the opposite Garganta viewpoint <em>below</em> the falls for good measure.
			</p>
			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190703-12.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>The rainbows we saw on both days were like nothing I've ever seen. They were so vivid and consistent that I was even able to photograph them. Remember what I said about photo quantity? Here's but a small selection:

			<p>As we took off from Foz do Iguacu airport the next day we got one final view over the falls out of the plane window which gave yet another new perspective, this time of the river basin feeding the falls.

			<h2>Tango in the Night</h2>
			
			<p>Buenos Aires is undeniably cool. Read any guidebook entry on Argentina and you are presented with lyrical, wistful hyperbole on the captivating magic of the capital and how you're predestined to fall in love with it on arrival.
			</p>
			<p>We arrived mid-evening to stay in the trendy <em>Palermo</em> district and found boutique and upmarket highstreet shopping (all still open at 7.30pm) and lively bars and cafes with patio seating spreading into the cobbled streets.
			</p>
			<p>It all seemed incredibly European; reminiscent of summer evenings in a Spanish or Italian city. This was just as true of the people. Everywhere we went in Bolivia, the indigenous roots of the Bolivians were evident to varying degrees. By contrast, the people of Buenos Aires looked to be an overwhelming majority of European mestizo descent rather than indigenous South American. Oddly, there was also an Austrian-German cultural heritage celebration going on:
			</p>
			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190701-01.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>According to our walking tour guide, there was mass immigration to Argentina from Italy in the late 1800s and early 20th century as part of the great European post-colonial migration. This Italian descent is obvious through the Argentinian Spanish dialect, mannerisms and food we experienced. My Spanish had gotten relatively workable by this point (Charlotte's still leagues ahead) but the change from the letters <em>LL</em> from a <em>yuh</em> sound to a <em>jzuh</em> sound knocked me completely - example: Calle (road) changes from <em>cayuh</em> to <em>cajzuh</em>. The Argentinians, like the Italians, also use hand gesticulations as a primary form of communication.
			</p>
			<p>The food of Buenos Aires includes a <b>lot</b> of pizza and pasta. The <em>Fugazza</em> - thick-based slab topped with a deluge of cheese and onions - at <em>Pizza Guerrin</em> was a particular highlight.
			</p>
			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190701-02.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>In fact, our eating standard was possibly highest here of anywhere so far. The first night we went to a high-end steak restaurant called <em>La Cabrera</em> for a massive spread of barbecued rump, another evening was juicy and flavoursome burgers from the say-what-you-see <em>Burger Joint</em>.
			</p>
			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190701-03.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>On the 2 nights we cooked at our AirBnB we had fantastic <em>Cuadril</em> cuts from the local Carrefour supermarket (no, we're not sure why they have French supermarkets either). It was so good we had it 2 days in a row.
			</em>
			
			<img class="lazy size-1" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190701-04.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>There was also <em>Freddie's</em> BBQ'd pork sandwich with the best chimichurri I've ever eaten. Most of these were accompanied by much Malbec.
			</p>
			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190701-05.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>Argentinians don't start their evenings early. It's perfectly expected to be in a bar on any given weekday until 3am. This troubled Charlotte's regular 10pm bedtime, but we forced ourselves to adapt in order to experience the true nightlife of BA. Aside from the bar scene, we had in mind to dance the tango - making use of our distantly remembered ballroom classes.
			</p>
			<p>We located a dancehall and established that Tuesday dance classes started around 10pm, with the real tango dancing commencing after that. We arrived to a shabby-chic upstairs dance floor with a stage and bar, flanked by dimly candle-lit tables.
			</p>
			
			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190701-06.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190701-07.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>We joined the class and enjoyed the warmup led by the eccentric dance instructor. After that it all started to go a little pear-shaped. Whilst we felt confident in having tangoed before, we had completely failed to realise that <em>Argentinian</em> tango was a completely different dance.
			</p>
			<p>After a very short initial period where Charlotte and I danced together, our instructor announced we were rotating partners. Charlotte was partnered by <em>Ernesto</em>, whose interest waned slightly once he enquired whether she had a boyfriend and found I was also in attendance. I was paired with a formidable, short, middle-aged Argentinian woman who was an experienced and skilled dancer. As I desperately concentrated on trying not to step on her feet and understand what she was saying to me in Spanish, she corrected my every foot placement, posture and upper-body movement. It was, by far, the hardest I've concentrated in the last 3 months.
			</p>
			<p>After the dance class finished there was a break in proceedings, so we relaxed with a jug of sangria until the real dancing got underway around 1am. Hereupon new dancers arrived and took to the floor, rotating partners and deftly conducting themselves around the room with seemingly zero effort. This was intimidating.
			</p>
			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190701-08.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>Deep into the second sangria jug (and when there were a safe number of other couples to draw attention) we mustered the confidence to take to the floor ourselves.  We danced the next "set" of 3 dances in our own non-Argentinian tango style and, I like to think, didn't draw unwanted attention. We did it! We tangoed in Buenos Aires! Now able to relax proper we sat to finish our drinks and appreciate the more skilled dancers, calling it a night around 2.30am (when things were still in full swing).
			</p>

			<p>Other highlights of BA included the <em>San Telmo</em> Sunday crafts market - which featured never-ending streets of artisan leather and woodwork - the colourful streets of <em>Boca</em> and the architecture of downtown. The centre has many grand buildings designed to emulate pre-WWII Parisian stylings, built under the assumption that Europe was going to destroy itself and BA would become the "Paris of the South".

			<h2>🎶 Viva Jujuy 🎵</h2>
			
			<p>Our border crossing into Argentina was the easiest yet. No queues, no Bolivian exit stamp. Rock up to the Argentinian immigration office, get the entry stamp and stroll across the bridge - there's always a bridge for added drama at Latin American borders.
		
			<p>With a 3 hour bus to our onward destination from the border town of <em>La Quiaca</em>, we immediately assimilated ourselves into the culture with fresh empanadas from a café near the bus station. We had arrived! These were the empanadas other South American countries had yet to deliver. Coincidentally also closest in appearance and content to a Cornish pasty so far.</p>
			
			<img class="lazy size-1" src="assets/images/placeholder-01.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190621-01.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>The northern highland region of <em>Jujuy</em> (pronounced hoo-hooey) is home to the <em>Quebrada de Humahuaca</em>, a band of brilliant coloured rock that stretches on for 100km. We wangled top-deck front seats on the bus and so had uninterrupted views across the sweeping terrain, which the highway cuts straight through. Whilst long buses can feel like lost time (or nap time), this one was an attraction in its own right as we awed at the technicolour geology.</p>
			
			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190621-02.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190621-03.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>We based ourselves in the small town of <em>Tilcara</em> - a place with quaint cafés and restaurants and many handicraft shops where we picked up the odd llama-themed souvenir.</p>
			
			<p>On our first morning we borrowed our hostel's dog (he decided he was coming with us and we couldn't have stopped him if we tried) and walked into the mountains with the promise of a grand waterfall. As we rose through the valley it became obvious that there was next to no water in the river and so we didn't bother to pay the entry to the viewpoint! Fortunately this didn't matter in the slightest as the surrounding cacti-studded canyon was ample reward.</p>

			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190621-04.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190621-05.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>The nearby town of <em>Purmamarca</em> promised a close-up view of the "mountain of 7 colours", which has some of the best colour spectrums in the range. We ambitiously hired bicycles and set out on a 60km round trip down the main highway. The roadside scenery was great but we hadn't considered that the road was too narrow to safely cycle alongside the haring traffic. This meant we had to settle for using the gravel track to the sides and nipping on and off the smooth asphalt as cars came and went for our own safety!</p>

			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190621-07.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>After a view of the mountains and another hearty empanada lunch in the cobbled market square of Purmamarca we hit the road again, stopping in the town of <em>Maimará</em> for another colourful viewpoint (and to rest our legs). It was a <b>really</b> tough uphill cycle back and our legs were completely shot by the time we arrived back in Tilcara.</p>

			<p>We stopped for a well-deserved drink in a patio bar that had a highly unusual pet sheep who wandered in and out of the kitchen (risky?) and tables at will.</p>
			
			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190621-11.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>Our dinner highlight in Tilcara was <em>La Peña de Carlitos</em>. A Peña is a traditional Argentinian tavern featuring live folk music. Carlitos was the busiest joint in town, with every table packed out from 20:30 onwards - we tried to go for a drink on our first night for the music at 9 and couldn't even get standing room - it was packed to the rafters. Learning our lesson, the second night we settled ourselves in for a steak dinner accompanied by a beautiful local Malbec before the show. The band comprised a guitar player, drummer, flautist/piper and a chap playing the local 8-stringed mandolin-style instrument. They really worked the crowd, getting everyone involved and making jokes in between numbers. They also sang a number of songs in praise of the Jujuy area which made the whole event feel very rural, despite the large number of Argentinian travellers in the audience.</p>
			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190621-12.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>The piper was incredible, and had a huge array of instruments with him, including this monstrous set of pan pipes which more resembled bamboo scaffolding.</p>
			
			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190621-13.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>Before heading South, we doubled back on ourselves to visit the crown jewel of the mountain range, the 14-coloured <em>Hornocal</em> mountain of Humahuaca. Avoiding the tour sellers at the bus station, we picked up a shared 4x4 transport up the mountain with a retired couple from Buenos Aires, stopping at the mid-point to admire the view back over the town.</p>
			
			<p>As we pulled over the top of the ridge, the mountains gave a grand reveal...</p>
			
			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190621-14.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>I've honestly never seen anything like it. The brilliance of the hues and the contrast between the sharply cut layers is indescribable. We walked over a second, lower ridge to get as close as we could and took a great many pictures, none of which do justice. I've not been to the Grand Canyon, and the Iguazú Falls were a week away yet, but the awe of the sight was on a par with what I'd expect from either of those.</p>
			
			<img class="lazy size-4" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190621-15.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>From Humahuaca we boarded a 4 hour bus South to the city of <em>Salta</em>, which had the odd nice colonial building but wasn't the most writable city we've visited so far. Its 'andean museum of high altitude' (rough translation) had one of the most unusual exhibitions I've seen - a collection of 3 mummified children aged from 6 to 15 who had been left at over 6,000m as sacrifices to the mountains. They were alive when they were left there and froze in their seated position and were perfectly preserved when they were discovered in a temple on an expedition in 19XX. Since then they have been cryogenically preserved and studied in the museum. One child is on display in the cryo-lab at a time, rotated each 6 months. I don't have any pictures since I found the exhibit a little uncomfortable; photos weren't permitted in any case.</p>
			
			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190621-16.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>The other highlight of Salta was the wine! A bottle of perfectly quaffable Malbec started at £1 in the supermarket. We took the rare opportunity to cook from scratch as we had a full kitchen to ourselves in our Airbnb, which meant plenty of opportunities to drink said wine! It's a tough life...</p>

			<h2>Wild Wild West</h2>
			
			<p>We reached Tupiza, our last destination in Bolivia, after a tortuous minibus journey from Uyuni through the mountains. On the plus side it gave us one final mind-bending view across the salt flats trying to work out where sky ended and salt reflection began. Thanks to Charlotte for covering the previous part of our trip and giving me a break from writing!</p>
			<p>Tupiza has some spectacular landscapes on its doorstep and a very <em>wild west</em> feel to it, what with the dusty tracks, giant cacti and rugged rock formations.</p>
			
			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190615-01.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>Keen to get into the cowboy spirit, we decided to explore the area by horse. With our local 'rancher' on his steed and Charlotte and I saddled up on our horses <em>Picaro</em> and <em>Negra</em> respectively, we set off into the hills replete with leather chaps and cowboy hats.</p>
			
			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190615-02.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>Having never ridden a horse before, I decided that not letting the horse know this was key to success. So, I tried to act confident and like I knew exactly what I was doing. Fortunately, I needn't have been concerned. Our horses were incredibly well-trained and knew where they were going. They were happy to trot along the beaten track without too much input - the occasional tug of the reins left or right to keep them on the straight and narrow or to stop was sufficient.</p>

			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190615-03.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>We rode for 3 hours through increasingly impressive terrain, stopping to rest (us or the horses I'm not quite sure, but I probably needed it more) and to admire the viewpoints.</p>

			<p>One of these was the <em>Puerta del Diablo</em>, which was a long and thin slab of rock seemingly dropped from above and impaled into the ground - it was hard to imagine how it formed in that way.</p>

			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190615-04.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190615-05.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>The far point of our ride was the <em>Cañon del Inca</em>, a large canyon (go figure) where we had a scramble up and over the rocks to work our way through the passage while our horses rested for the return journey.</p>

			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190615-06.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">

			<p>Whilst we weren't trotting at a mellow pace to enjoy the spectacular scenery and take photos, we had the chance to break into a canter and feel like real cowboys. Negra responded very well to a kissing sound as encouragement to set off at pace, and would keep going until either she decided it was time to return to a more leisurely pace or until my testicles told me the same thing.</p>

			<p>Whilst I felt in control and <em>mostly</em> comfortable considering I was straddling a large equine, I knew I'd feel sore the next day (and in reality for several days after). Charlotte - having considerably more horse-riding experience than I - was able to manage the cantering much more deftly, settling into a good rhythm with her stallion as I bounced along behind trying to hold myself in place with my sore thighs.</p>

			<p>After our horsing around we spent the afternoon sunbathing by the pool at our hotel, catching up on some reading and appreciating the strong heat of the sun despite the altitude.</p>

			<p>So goodbye Bolivia! In total we spent just shy of 4 weeks here - the longest stint in any country we've visited so far - and it's been a journey of variety. We've been to jungles (both rainforest and urban), trekked through snowy mountains, explored high-altitude lake islands, crossed deserts, marvelled at salt flats and the wild west. We've travelled by plane, bus, boat, bike, 4x4, horse and on foot. Next stop, Argentina! Bring on the malbec and steaks.</p>

			<h2>A Seasoning's Greetings</h2>
			
			<p>Hello, Charlotte here, guest blogging for Simon to talk about Uyuni and the impressive Bolivian Salt Flats. Here goes...</p>

			<p>We had been warned about Uyuni and it being a little *ahem* soulless and it really lived up to this impression - think end of the world apocalypse, stray dogs, broken down vehicles, windy and really cold (a common theme in this blog). </p>
			
			<img class="lazy size-1" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190610-01.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>However, the reason we were here was the beautiful landscapes and mind blowing geology of Bolivia. We signed up for a 3 day, 2 night tour of the salt flats and the surrounding areas. Bundled into a car that Simon reminds me is a Nissan Patrol we sped off across the salty plains the following morning.</p>

			<p>Our first stop was a train cemetery. When the world was exploiting Bolivia's mines at the turn of the century they needed transport for their goods. When the mine collapsed they were abandoned and now serve as a giant playground for visitors, and more specifically, Simon. James Bond, eat your heart out!</p>

			<p>A little on the formation of the salt flats - it seems that no-one is 100% sure on this one. The running theory is that there were once a series of very large prehistoric lakes (or maybe a sea), but then the tectonic plates did their thing and lifted up the Andean mountains, created the Altiplano (flat high plateau of Bolivia) and cut off the original lake's drainage outlets. Over many years, due to the lack of fresh water and changing climate, the lake dried up leaving only the mineral deposits behind. It now measures over 10,000m² and is the largest salt flat in the world. It's at 3656m altitude and contains over half of the world's lithium resources.</p>

			<p>Back to the trip… Lunch was at the salt hotel, and starting point of the now extinct Bolivian leg of the Dakar rally. This short-lived leg ended as the salt screwed up the cars (well duh, even GCSE Chemistry could've told me that). Regardless, it started a nice tradition of flags being placed at the start line which has been continued by tourists.</p>

			
			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190610-03.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>After lunch we zoomed across the salt. Although there were no roads it was a surprisingly smooth ride and the jeep could move pretty fast, reaching speeds of 90km/h. The white of the salt was blinding and the hexagon formations of the salt were really cool. The stark contrast between the blue of the sky and the white of the salt was very reminiscent of bluebird skiing days. Under foot it felt surprisingly solid. </p>

			
			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190610-04.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>Next stop: our photoshoot. The salt flats are known for their pictures which play with perspective. We'd bought Larry the llama as our prop, but turns out these pictures aren't as easy to take as you'd think. Our guide Victor was a pro though, whipping out the car mats to lie down on and taking everyone's photos with much more skill. </p>

			<p>We then headed to the <em>Isla de Incahuasi</em> which is an island sticking out of the salt flats. It offers unparalleled 360° views over the salt flats, making it very easy to imagine how they were once a lake/sea. It is also covered in <b>huge</b> cacti (some 8m tall). As the cacti grow at approx 2cm per year, thinking about the age of these was pretty impressive. </p>

			
			<img class="lazy size-4" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190610-08.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>We left the flats on Day 2 for deserts, lagoons and animals. </p>

			
			<h3>Deserts</h3>
			
			<p>Our first desert stop was the <em>soldados de piedra</em>, the soldiers of stone. These rocky formations that were once coral reefs in the aforementioned lake/sea. With the draining of the water, the corals were exposed and due to the tides; the rocks came out wonky.</p>

			
			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190610-09.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>The Bolivian people had a legend that they were soldiers in the war with Chile for sea access. They (unsurprisingly) didn't do a very good job and Bolivia lost its sea border in 1884. This <em>War of the Pacific</em> stemmed from a dispute over a high gunpowder tax which the land in question produced. The border disagreement is an ongoing debate that Bolivia actually presented to the International Court of Justice. However last year the ICJ issued a final and binding decision that Chile was not obliged to negotiate in granting Bolivia sea access. Having lost, the Bolivians are waiting for new presidents on both sides to reopen the debate.</p>

			<p>We also came across the stone tree, a large rock carved out in the middle of the <em>Siloli</em> desert. </p>

			
			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190610-10.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>The Siloli desert is often called the inspiration for Dali's clocks and desert images, as no-one knows how they got there. However apparently Dali never actually went to Bolivia, and there's a similar desert in Spain. You can see why though...</p>

			
			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190610-11.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<h3>Lagoons</h3>
			
			<p>The Bolivian highlands have numerous lagoons, often home to flamingos and filled with minerals. The white you see in the pictures is borax, a naturally occurring sediment, not salt.</p>

			
			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190610-12.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>This lagoon is filled with red microorganisms which are the diet of the flamingos. </p>

			
			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190610-13.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190610-14.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>There are three types of flamingo, the James, the Andean and the Chilean and they can survive in these icy pools by breaking the ice with their necks. If that's not possible they'll migrate.</p>

			
			<h3>Animals</h3>
			<p>Apart from the flamingos we also saw vizcachas (kinda like Andean rabbits with long tails) and Andean foxes (which were much less mangey than London ones).</p>

			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190610-17.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>That night we arrived at our hostel and were greeted with beautiful views of the night sky and the Milky Way. Thanks to Victoria from our group for letting us share her camera to try and capture it. Our resolve was limited by the icy temperatures outside, but we managed to get a few to work.</p>

			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190610-19.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>Day 3 started with a 4:15 wake up and a trip to the highest part of our journey. At 5000m were the fumaroles, big jets of steam coming naturally out of the ground, and bubbling mud ponds. However at a bitter -9°C in the darkness, I think I must have only left the car for max 3 minutes! We then went on to glorious hot springs, which at 39°C were a great antidote to the cold, and a pretty awesome place to watch the sunrise.</p>

			
			<img class="lazy size-4" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190610-20.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>The rest of the day was the trip back to Uyuni, but it continued in the same theme, with beautiful landscapes lining the route. Oh, and one more rocky playground for Simon to climb.</p>

			<h2>Dinosaurs and Silver</h2>
			
			<p>Sucre - Bolivia's true capital. The site of the first rumblings of uproar against Spanish rule, vocalised in the "First Cry for Freedom". On the 25th of May 1809 the local population took to the streets to throw out the unpopular president Garcia Pizarro. This uprising was the first catalyst for South American independence, even though Bolivia as it is now known was the last to be liberated.</p>

			<p>Each year this event is celebrated on the 25th May with street parties, marching bands and drinking. The epicentre of celebrations is the square now commemorated as <em>Plaza 25 de Mayo</em>.</p>

			
			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190608-01.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>I learned all of this after we arrived in Sucre, unsuspectingly, on the 25th of May 2019. Having not learned this part of Bolivian history in La Paz, we were wondering why the town centre was so loud and chaotic, until: "wait, Charlotte, what's the name of this square…"</p>

			<p><em>If you can't beat them, join them</em>. We'd been looking for somewhere to sit outside and have lunch, so we walked straight into the middle of the street party and ordered the only 2 dishes on the traditional Bolivian menu - <em>chorizo</em> and <em>mondongo</em>. The former was as expected - indigestion-inspiring sausages with hot sauce. Charlotte's mondongo was comparatively high risk, transpiring to be a goulash-like stew featuring pork and tripe. It wasn't the absolute worst thing we've eaten, but we made a note to never order it again.</p>

			<p>Once the partying subsided a little we could appreciate Sucre in all its colonial glory. </p>

			
			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190608-02.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>Whilst La Paz hasn't allowed old architecture to halt it's expansion and development, much of Sucre still feels like it has been transplanted from Mediterranean Spain. It's a quaint and relatively small city, which was washed in warm and flattering sunshine every day. Given its relatively low (for Bolivia) 2810m altitude, it was much warmer than we were used to!</p>

			
			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190608-03.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>The remainder of our stay was relaxed. We cooked and played cards with the other British, French and German guests in our hostel (s**thead is a game all British travellers can seemingly bond over) and visited the <em>Museum of Indigenous Art</em>, which showcases incredibly ornate Bolivian textile weavings. The other attraction we visited is the slightly left-field <em>Parque Cretacico</em>.</p>

			
			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190608-04.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>Parque Cretacico is 5km from the city centre and hosts the longest continuous dinosaur footprints recorded in the world (320m). These are fossilised in limestone that was mined for years by a local cement company. In 1959 they reached a seam of limestone with a high magnesium oxide content that was useless for cement and so stopped mining. Over the next 20 years rain slowly eroded this layer, by pure chance revealing the footprints in the rock below.</p>

			
			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190608-05.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>What you can't see from the picture above is that these footprints now lie in near-vertical orientation as tectonic folds have shifted what was lake sediment into this position. The long tracks of footprints show various Sauropods, Theropods and other classifications moving to and from the lake to drink.</p>

			
			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190608-06.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">

			<img class="lazy size-1" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190608-08.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>The footprints are now preserved and well studied by paleontologists and the park has opened around them giving tours past this surprisingly fascinating wall. The cement plant still operates next door (with imported rock), juxtaposed against the attraction.</p>

			
			<img class="lazy size-4" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190608-09.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>Next up after Sucre was the formerly grand city of Potosí. Hope you're enjoying the history lesson as there's more to come...</p>
			
			<p>Potosí built up in the shadow of the grand <em>Cerro Rico</em> - Rich Mountain - that held an extraordinarily large vein of silver. The city is home to the Potosí mint - the most famous of the South American mints where the colonial Spanish <em>Real</em> was produced. The museum tour through the <b>huge</b> buildings (200 rooms and 11 courtyards) was interesting if uncomfortably cold - Potosí sits at a dizzying 4067m and as soon as you step out of the warm sun the temperature plummets.</p>

			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190608-10.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>Originally the Real was stamped into non-uniform coins by hand. These "shapeless" coins were easy to fake and even easier to cut, meaning small amounts were surreptitiously removed from the circulating coins. Over time the weight and value steadily decreased.</p>

			<p>To improve the process, they installed huge wooden machines driven by mules that would press ingots into 0.5mm sheets that could be precisely cut, milled and stamped into uniform currency. These Cadiz oak rollers are well preserved and the museum holds a relatively interesting collection of shiny things.</p>

			
			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190608-11.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>But here's the really interesting part of the tour... Ever wondered where the US Dollar symbol ($) comes from? <b>Note</b> that there is no definitive agreement on its origin, but Potosí claims one of several theories.</p>

			<p>Where each Real mint had its own unique marque on its coins for identification, Potosí had the letters PTSI superimposed:</p>

			
			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190608-12.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>As the first independent South American currencies were issued, these became "Pesos", also minted in Potosi. The $ symbol was first used for this currency and bears a resemblance to a simplified Potosí mint stamp. The US Dollar was created (also originally minted in Potosi) and carried over the same symbol.</p>

			
			<p>We only had one day in Potosí, so there wasn't a huge amount more we did aside from wander around and appreciate its architecture. It has a picturesque central square, but also the feel that it hasn't let colonial past prevent a modern city from developing. The Bolivia we had seen so far still feels authentically South American; here you could see there was some money and 'modern' (European or North American) style floating around.</p>

			<h2>What goes up must come down</h2>
			
			<p>Against all odds and with memories of the Inca Trail not yet faded, Charlotte agreed of her own free will to go on another trek.</p>

			<h3>El Choro</h3>
			
			<p>The Cotopata national park is an hour bus north of La Paz and is the starting point for a 3 day trek named <em>El Choro</em>. Tackling this one on our own we hired the full suite of tent, sleeping bags, cooking gear and rucksacks from a camping shop in La Paz and left our usual bags behind in the hostel.</p>

			<p>Arriving at the national park we were dropped next to a brilliant, cyan-blue lagoon with no signs of life bar a small cabin where we signed in. Here we met Steven and Elliot (Yank and Kiwi respectively) who were setting off on the same route. They turned out to be mad-keen mountaineers taking a break from summiting glaciers whilst the wind was high, so we let them speed on ahead.</p>

			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190604-01.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>The hike began with an ascent from 4650 metres above sea level to the highest point of the trail at around 4800m. There was snow on the ground, the temperature was low and the landscape was barren lunar rubble.</p>

			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190604-02.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>From here the trek was all downhill so we were presented with a long, sweeping overview of the route thag lay ahead.</p>

			
			<img class="lazy size-4" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190604-03.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190604-04.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>It was a tough endeavour. The first day we covered 20 km to 3000m, starting at 11am and reaching camp at 6.30pm. The last few hundred metres were an unexpected challenge as we faced traversing a recent landslide to get to the riverside. Thinking we were home and dry, we then discovered that February had seen the worst wet season in memory, sending a surge of water that had annihilated half of the campsite and the bridge over the river. The remnants of the original bridge remained strewn near its makeshift replacement.</p>

			
			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190604-05.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>Approximations on bridges became a common theme as we progressed through the trek, each presenting a new method of makeshift construction.</p>

			
			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190604-06.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>Day 2 was long, not that day 1 was short! We set off at 7.15am and covered 23km of undulating terrain to 2000m. The <em>Subida del Diablo</em> - "ascent of the devil" - was a particularly gruelling staircase ascent carved into the side of a valley. Spirits remained high (perhaps aside from this climb) throughout the day given the breathtaking scenery we passed.</p>

			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190604-07.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190604-08.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>Whilst day 1 had been sunny, day 2 was gently overcast, with enough light for brilliant views but enough cloud cover to keep walking temperatures pleasant.</p>

			<p>The third day was comparatively a walk in the park. Having broken the back of the trail, it was a mere 3.5 hours to cover the last 8km to the village of Chairo at the end of the trail, where we had a well-deserved ice cream after a total of 51.5km walked.</p>

			<p>The journey was characterised by a wide variety of microclimates. Since the descent was so sharp and fast, we went from bare rock to forest by day 1 camp, with ferns and conifers at day 2 start giving way to increasingly dense and lush jungle. Towards the end the path really closed over as we fought our way through coffee plants and citrus fruit.</p>

			<p>The mountainside was a patchwork quilt of colour; deep greens peppered with beautiful violet flowers. The wildlife didn't disappoint either, with brightly attired birds and the largest butterfly I've ever seen - larger than my splayed hand - with vibrant fuchsia and yellow wings. Sadly the majority of these were apt at hiding or flying off when I pulled out my camera.</p>

			
			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190604-14.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>After the first half day, there was no civilisation to speak of save for the odd campsite. Elliot, Steven and a couple of other walkers with a guide (one of whom we had met before at the Bolivian border) were walking on the same itinerary as us. Each evening we'd all regroup and talk over the day's sights as we prepped our respective campstove dinners, before retreating early into our tents and down layers to beat the cold.</p>

			<p>The <em>micro</em> (local minibus) back to La Paz was quite remarkable in itself as we sped at breakneck speeds across the "new" highway (built 1995-2005) linking the <em>Yungas</em> region and La Paz. This road replaced the original track known as <em>Death Road</em>. Officially recognised as 'The World's Most Dangerous Road', you may have seen it on BBC's <em>Top Gear</em>. Tour operators in La Paz offer mountain bike trips down the road, so the next day we set off to descend through the same mountains all over again!</p>

			<h3>Death Road</h3>
			
			<p>We were picked up by <em>Altitude biking</em> at 07:00 to drive back up to the national park entrance for our safety briefing and to don the mandatory brightly colored suits and PPE.</p>

			<p>Our half-hour "warm-up" ride was down the aforementioned new highway. Here we were let loose to speed as fast as we liked, tucking to beat the wind resistance and passing multi-tonne haulage vehicles on the outside - nerve-racking and exhilarating in equal measure. At a mid-way break, our guide <em>Marrenka</em> divulged that fatalities are still common on the new road. Below you can just spot a green bus that plunged hundreds of metres a few years previously.</p>

			<p>As we reached Death Road itself, Marrkena explained to us that this inexplicable track was carved into the mountainside by African slaves in the 1930s and 40s, allowing agricultural trade between  the Yungas jungle and the high Andean cities.</p>

			<p>The road is scarcely wide enough for a 4-wheeled vehicle along much of its length and the sheer drop from the side ranges from 40 to several hundred metres. Fatalities when this was the main road were so common the media didn't even report them all. As you cycle along the edge (which is required to avoid blind corners) with your wheels jumping and slipping over the gravel and rock terrain you can feel the adrenaline really pumping.</p>

			<p>Our team included <em>Yamato</em> and <em>Machine</em> who would take turns in leading us down the road and taking obscene numbers of photos (over 400 were shared over WhatsApp afterwards!). At least Charlotte and I could concentrate on the road and not worry about taking our own snaps.</p>

			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190604-18.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>At one point Yamato surrendered the lead to grab some videos and sent me off leading the pack. Without anyone in front to act as pacesetter or show the way I got the biggest adrenaline rush I've had for a long time as I let the bike run and pushed myself to take each corner as fast as I dared.</p>

			<p>We stopped at a few strategic points for photo-opps and refreshments, finally ending in a rural village where we had a few beers to unwind with the rest of the group - mostly Aussies - as they hosed down the bikes.</p>

			<p>The scenery on the way down was just as impactful as the first time around, with the added twist of seeing everything from a dizzying height!</p>

			<p>Rather than taking the tour bus back to La Paz, we opted to head to the nearby town of Coroico to relax for a few days by the pool at a quaint hostel called <em>Sol y Luna</em>. Bolivia thus far was non-stop so a few down days reading and catching up on blog writing were just what the doctor ordered (and oh boy did I have a lot of writing to do...)</p>

			<h2>Welcome to the jungle, we got wetland plains</h2>
			
			<p>The Amazon basin stretches over 7 million square kilometres, drawing in water from over 1,100 tributaries across 8 countries in South America [<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_basin">1</a>]. The Bolivian Amazon is accessed from the small jungle town of <em>Rurrenabaque</em>, where we set off on a 3 day tour of the "Pampas" wetland plains.</p>

			<p>To get to "Rurre" from La Paz one can either take a bus that's been variously described to me as "terrifying", "horrific" and "24 hours of absolute hell", or a 40 minute flight. Go figure, we opted for the latter. To describe Rurre's airport as basic is to oversell it - the below picture gives an idea of the scale - but it has bags of charm! The plane probably seated 40 passengers and the runway was tiny; in fact I couldn't see tarmac for the dense tree cover until we were 2 metres above it. This was the view as we landed:</p>

			<p>Our tour operator, <em>Mashaquipe</em>, picked us up from the "arrivals lounge" and drove us the short 5 minutes from runway to town centre for a short briefing and to our hostel. The next morning we set off on the 3 hour dirt track journey into the <em>Madidi</em> national park. This was advertised as being in a "jeep". In reality it was a couple of battered Toyota people carriers, driven at great speed to even out the bumps (sort of):</p>

			<p>Having expected to spend most of the tour watching for elusive and hard-to-spot animals, on the drive we saw 5 sloths, an ostrich, some egrets, spoon billed waders, many capybaras and a group of caymans. This made for several unscheduled stops along the road, including one where the car in front of ours hit a cow. Both cow and car escaped without serious injuries - it was a small cow.</p>

			<p>Once we arrived at the Yungas river, we bid adieu to our skillful-if-chaotic drivers and embarked on a longboat up the river a few clicks to our Ecolodge. We stayed in a lovely <em>cabaña</em> that Charlotte, Laura and I shared with a large family of bats living in the rafters. Whilst the scattering of droppings in the morning weren't ideal, we took comfort that our new roomies would eat away at the mosquitos for us. Our fellow Brits on the tour, Rachael and Cathal, weren't as lucky and only had frogs for company.</p>

			<p>On the subject of mozzies, I was expecting to be eaten alive in the jungle but it had been relatively cool the few days before we arrived and so a lot had died off. It was a very manageable 25°C with blue skies whilst we were there which was pleasantly hot without the humidity making it stifling.</p>

			
			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190601-05.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">

			<p>Our daily itinerary consisted of taking the boat up- or down-stream for a few hours to spot waterside wildlife or to access other areas and walk the wetlands. Our guide <em>Eber</em> had eyes like a hawk and generally pointed things out before we could spot them, but over the course of 3 days you definitely get your eye in for distinguishing a floating log from a spectacled cayman.</p>

			<p>I'm never going to win any prizes for my wildlife photography, but we did see an incredible array of species and in great number. Amongst our group we had a tour leader from Canada who had been into the Amazon all over South America and who couldn't believe how much we were seeing. To list off a few not already mentioned we saw wood storks, maguary storks, howler monkeys (we heard these at 5am too), yellow breasted capuchin monkeys, turtles, an anteater, green parrots, a porcupine and a trio of macaws. I couldn't believe how close we were able to get to the caymans and monkeys.</p>

			<p>The highlight above all of these was undoubtedly the pink river dolphins. Because the water in the river is so murky, the dolphins never develop their full outer grey skin and so have a quite striking pink hue. Whilst underwater it's impossible to see them, but the river was absolutely <em>teeming</em> with them. They popped up with unexpected regularity around the boat to blow out air or just play near us. We even got to swim with them - with assurances given that the nearby caymans would not be interested in us! Clearly unconcerned by us, they came incredibly close by. It was incredibly hard to train a camera on them since you couldn't see where they'd pop up next. Below are my best attempts.</p>

			<p>On our second evening, Eber took us Piranha fishing. Whilst my preconception of the ferocity of pirhanas is based entirely on Tom & Jerry cartoons, I have to say it's not a million miles from the truth. Casting a simple hand line around a metre and a half with a single hook and raw beef for bait you could immediately feel the little blighters darting around and nibbling chunks. Once we got a feel for snagging them with a well-timed yank of the line we reeled in a good haul of them. Laura and I had the most success; Charlotte caught a fish early on and rapidly lost interest, having achieved the goal. The hardest part was de-hooking them since their razor-sharp teeth were not to be meddled with. As a boat we landed 22 fish before Eber decided we didn't need any more.</p>

			<p>Whilst we fished, Eber gutted the fish off the side of the boat and the remaining fish immediately devoured the entrails - turns out piranhas are not fussy eaters. The fried fish at dinner were very tasty, though there isn't a huge amount of bang for your buck with piranha meat so you need a few to make a good portion.</p>

			<p>The final hurrah for the trip was hunting in the marshland for anacondas. We joined forces with another group and their guide to maximise chances for everyone of a sighting. Sadly it was not to be, despite an hour and a half squelching in wellies with mud and water lapping at the brims. We did at least manage to find a baby snake back at the camp as solace.</p>

			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190601-19.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>Overall our trip was a very relaxing affair. Pottering around in boats in the sun is one of my favourite activities. Combine this with ample wildlife, great food, swimming, sunrises and the scenery of the dense jungle and it made for a great trip. Cayman selfie for the win:</p>

			<h2>Witches and cocaine - La Paz</h2>
			
			<p>Our next Latin American capital was La Paz. For any pedants reading, Sucre is the constitutional capital but La Paz has the de facto title and houses the national government.</p>

			
			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190529-02.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>As usual we took a walking tour of the city to understand a little about Bolivia. We had an energetic and funny young guide called Pablo who gave us both entertaining stories and history:</p>

			
			<ul>
			<li>One of the country's more colourful presidents gave away 30% of the Bolivia's land in exchange for a particularly beautiful white horse</li>
			<li>Each year in March the country mourns the day in 1889 that it lost the sea in the war with Chile</li>
			<li>At our meeting point in Plaza Murillo you can see bullet holes from the 2003 war between the government military and the police - 65 died</li>
			<li>This government is led by Evo Morales Ayma, the first indigenous leader of Bolivia, who won the premiership around 30 years ago with over 50% of the vote (an historic margin).</li>
			<ul>
				<li>In his first years he made great economic decisions such as nationalising Bolivia's gas reserves and he passed historic antidiscrimination laws for the indigenous people.</li>
				<li>Latterly, he has shown signs of corruption after too long in power - he has changed the constitution in order to allow his reign to continue so long and is running for re-election in October of 2019 unconstitutionally.</li>
				<li>He also built himself a huge new palace... see the original in the foreground and new building behind in the picture above</li>
			</ul>
			<li>The Cruz Verde (green cross) on La Paz's museum street - one of the few colonial Spanish streets remaining - was placed to ward off a female ghost who used to kidnap drunken men</li>
			
			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190529-03.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190529-04.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<li>Protests in La Paz are incredibly commonplace - a week-long demonstration was once held against a schedule change to <em>The Simpsons</em> by a national broadcaster. It was successful and they reverted the schedule!</li>
			<li>The San Pedro prison in the centre of the city is quite the place…</li>
			<ul>
				<li>It has its own cocaine lab (a gram supposedly costs around 60 Bolivianos - circa £6.60 at time of writing)</li>
				<li>Many inmates live inside with their families, who are free to come and go.</li>
				<li>With enough money, one can buy or rent increasingly lavish cells or even leave the prison for the evening to go drinking.</li>
				<li>A British drug smuggler called Thomas MacFadden used to run guided tours of the prison <b>that were recommended by Lonely Planet</b>. I highly recommend the book <em>Marching Powder</em> which describes his time in this unbelievable place (and which is banned in Bolivia!)</li>
			</ul>
			</ul>
			
			<p>During and after our tour we sampled some fantastic street food from the many markets of La Paz, including <em>salteñas</em> (sort of saucy deep friend empanadas), chorizo rolls and <em>palta</em> sandwiches - avocado, tomato and cheese. La Paz has few supermarkets since Bolivians prefer to shop in traditional local markets, buying from their favoured <em>Caseras</em> - the women who run the stalls.</p>

			<p>The city has a lot of great food on offer in general. Highlights included:</p>

			<p><b><em>Hallwright's</em></b> wine bar - Bolivian wine is actually pretty good, versus Colombian wine famously described by our guide book as “vile”. <b><em>Popular</em></b> - a gourmet 3 course lunch of traditional Bolivian flavours prepared with oodles of style. <b><em>Sol y Luna</em></b> - a Dutch-owned pub where - I am unashamed to say - we had a delicious chicken tikka masala.</p>

			<p>La Paz is the highest capital city in the world, which is easy to take at face value from the top of the city's cable-car network (a remarkably efficient and tranquil way of travelling). Here the view is a sprawling mass of red brick surrounded on all sides by snow capped mountains, as if the city were built in a giant crater.</p>

			<p>One of the main tourist attractions in the city is the <em>Mercado de Brujas</em> - witches market. Whilst the modern witches have relocated to the neighbouring city of <em>El Alto</em> you can still buy all manner of ritualistic items, herbal remedies and instant-fix powders promising anything from love and luck to wealth. Oh, and llama foetuses. Those are very important for rituals…</p>

			<p>All this is sold right alongside tourist fare of knitwear, keychains, t-shirts and all other imaginable tat.</p>
			
			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190529-11.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>In the same district there was the interesting - if basic - coca museum where we learned about the indigenous medicinal and cultural uses of the plant and the rise and infamy of its narcotic extracts.</p>

			<p>We ended up spending quite a bit of time in La Paz since it was our stepping off point for several tours or trips. Our research had prepared us for a gritty and unpleasant city, which I suppose in places it was; for example we were warned to stay well away from the prison at night to avoid being hit by packets of cocaine thrown over the walls. There are 2 sides to every coin however and it also has modern, metropolitan quarters with hip cafés serving coffee 500 different ways! I'd say in summary that it felt authentic, which is a positive thing for me.</p>

			<h2>Lake Titicaca - you say caca, I say...</h2>
			
			<p>My first learning from visiting the highest navigable lake in the world (that one was beforehand in the guide book) is that the name is pronounced something like Ti-ti-hcha-hcha. Try saying it like you're trying to bring up a lot of phlegm from your throat.</p>

			<p>After arriving back into Cusco from our trek, we hopped straight on an overnight bus to <em>Puno</em>, a lakeside town near the Peru-Bolivia border on the Peruvian side. We travelled with “Peru Hop”, who target tourists needing a few consecutive tickets with the flexibility to make changes. Being a tourist vehicle it was actually <em>not</em> a terrible night's sleep, but arriving into “Cozy hostal” at around 5am we promptly conked out on the sofa for a few hours until check-in.</p>

			<p>After a revitalising waffle breakfast at a local gaffe, we headed for the port to hop on a boat bound for the <em>Uros</em> floating islands. Around a half hour boat ride from the shores of Puno, this archipelago of tiny islands numbers around 1,000 “land”-masses and 2,500 people. The current population is around 60% of its original size as the hard life of living on a tiny floating mass of dried reeds becomes less appealing to new generations. Traditionally hunter-gatherers, the remaining islanders are mostly in the business of tourism as the peak season brings in boat after boat of outsiders keen to understand island life.</p>

			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190527-01.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190527-02.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>We stopped off at one of the smaller islands, where their leader demonstrated to us how an island comes to be. Each is constructed by hand by its inhabitants by cutting square blocks of lake reed roots and strapping them together with rope. Around 20 pieces, each a 2-3 metres long/wide, form the basis of an island. Several layers of cut and dried reeds laid on top in alternating orientations provide a stable base to walk on, with new layers added every 1 or 2 weeks. The island we visited houses 5 families - all friends - whose parents and siblings live on other islands. They rotate the position of island leader each year and have a surprising level of mod-cons including TV, radio and electric lighting powered by solar panels. There is even a football pitch island!</p>

			<p>Island life must be very challenging, since everything is a boat ride away. Children go to junior school on larger islands and high-school on the mainland. It was easy to see how tourism brings in the money - whilst we were there we took a ride on their handmade dragon boat for an extra small fee and there were a wide variety of handicrafts for sale. Plus, there are no taxes!</p>

			<p>On the boat ride across Titicaca we got the other key stats. It's the 2nd biggest lake in South America and would take 14 hours to cross by boat. It's quite staggering to stand on the shore and comprehend that you're not looking out to sea; in fact that you're 3800m above sea level. On average the lake is 20m deep and 9°C and is home to many trout which made for a delicious ceviche dinner.</p>

			<p>Our next stop was just across the border in Copacabana. Whilst it's a delightful little town, after having Barry Manilow's 1978 hit on repeat in my head for a few days I was ready to leave…</p>

			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190527-08.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">

			<p>We stayed in a beautiful hostal (top so far on the trip) called <em>La Cupula</em>, which had cosy rooms, a fire in the evenings and enviable views across the lake from its garden. We spent a lot of time relaxing in the hammocks and I spent a lot of time on their slack line… in between feeding their 4 pet Alpacas!</p>

			<p>The town centre had a few bars where we watched the sun set over the lake and drank cocktails, and an Irish-Bolivian breakfast cafe serving the most amazing home comfort - home-made baked beans! Along the waterfront there were a series of identical open-front food joints serving trout - the Trucha “a la Diavola” was an exquisite spiced whole fish with peppers, chips and rice for less than £3. So good we went twice…</p>

			
			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190527-12.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>From Copacabana, boats leave twice a day for <em>Isla del Sol</em> - a small, beautiful and tranquil island with no roads and no vehicles. We spent a day and a night there hiking to the viewpoints with a local dog we adopted and called "Waliki" - a greeting in the local language.</p>

			<p>In the evening we watched the sunset, which was utterly spectacular. I don't think I've ever seen the sun set in 360 degrees before:</p>

			<p>After sundown we had the most succulent and flavoursome trout dish from a tiny restaurant called <em>Las Velas</em> (The Candles) where they cook over gas and you eat by candlelight. Here, we met Katie and Alex who turned out to be from Cornwall and close friends of friends (shout out to Kate and Declan). Katie was the year above me at secondary school and I trained in Taekwon do with her sister. Truly, the world is a tiny, tiny place.</p>

			<h2>“The Journey is the Destination”</h2>
			
			<p>Ok, so first a disclaimer. Yes, that is an ironic title. It is the slogan of our tour agency for the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu, <em>Alpaca Expeditions</em>. So, where to start… rather than trying to do this chronologically, I'm going to split the blog into sections since it covers 4 days!</p>

			<h3>Itinerary</h3>
			
			<p>Our trek along the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu was 4 days and 3 nights. We were picked up from our Cusco hostel at 4am and drove for 2-3 hours in the coldest minibus I've ever traveled in to our stepping off point at <em>Ayapata</em>. Here we met the rest of our group (Laura, Charlotte and I plus 2 lovely Americans called Shannon and Christina - Team Bananallama), the porters and our guide. We had breakfast as the sun rose over the surrounding mountains and shimmered across the glaciers.</p>

			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190524-01.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p><b>Day 1</b> was 14 km to our first campsite at 3300m. This was a reasonable introduction to the trek with mostly undulating terrain and sunshine, save for a small afternoon sprinkling of rain to save us getting too complacent.</p>

			<p><b>Day 2</b> was the big day of walking - 16 km with 900m ascent over “Dead Woman's Pass” (named for the shape of the mountain, not in memoriam) and 620m descent to lunch, followed by a second 420m ascent and 400m descent. The hike up to the pass through the thin air was exhilarating, with my sprint finish to the viewpoint giving a good lung-burning sensation. Charlotte disagrees, but for me the hardest part was the never-ending slippery stone steps down from the pass.</p>

			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190524-02.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>It rained on and off throughout the day, meaning views came and went but the rugged landscape was impressive in all conditions.</p>

			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190524-03.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p><b>Day 3</b> was the picturesque day as we covered 10 km across jungle-clad mountain-side path to our final campsite. We were incredibly lucky to have sunshine all day whilst the trail provided some of the best panoramic vistas across the mountain range. I don't have the vocabulary to articulate how beautiful the landscape is so I won't try! The photos don't do it justice either but I gave it a try anyway.</p>

			<img class="lazy size-4" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190524-05.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p><b>Day 4</b> was an <b>early</b> start (3am) to let the porters get on their way to the train home, and to get ourselves at the front of the queue to hike the last few kilometres uphill to the Sun Gate. We saw shooting stars as we were getting up which got spirits high despite the time, but the following 2 hour wait for the trail to open in the cold darkness was <b>not</b> pleasant! </p>

			<p>From the Sun Gate we got our first views of Machu Picchu and watched the sun rise before walking down to the lost city to tour the ruins with our guide. Unbelievably, another baking hot sunny day.</p>

			<h3>History</h3>
			
			<p>Our guide Miguel was a character and a knowledgeable group leader. Part-time guide and part-time artist, he surprised us on the third day as he ran off ahead and serenaded us on an Andean flute (Quena) as we came around the valley. The sound of the pentatonic scale carried all the way around the valley in a haunting, ethereal drone.</p>
			
			<p>As we progressed through the trek, Miguel would stop us and give us history lessons. The first of these came a few hours into the first day, when he led us to the edge of the cliff we were walking along to give a sudden and grand reveal of the first of many Inca settlements we would visit.</p>

			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190524-06.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>The highlights I took away from our brief history of the Incas were:</p>

			<p>
			<ol>
			<li>The name Inca only refers to the leaders of the civilisation; lower classes were simply Andean people</li>
			<li>They were one of the of the last “ancient” civilisations but one of the most advanced. They united [conquered] 4 regional Andean tribes and assimilated craft techniques from each - e.g. stone cutting learnings from the master cutters around lake Titicaca</li>
			<li>There are 4 types of Inca trails - pilgrimage, military, commercial and urban - with outposts along the way for food, supplies and temples. Many of the archeological sites that remain now are these outposts, since larger urban centres have become modern cities</li>
			<li>The Spanish chroniclers wrote that the Andean people had no written language, since they did not communicate using alphabetic writing. Trail runners called “chaskis” would ferry ropes adorned with knots and coloured strings that conveyed concepts, more similar to Egyptian hieroglyphs.</li>
			</ol></p>

			<h3>Sights</h3>
			
			<p>As much as the title of the blog <b><em>is</em></b> ironic, the Inca Trail itself was as impressive as Machu Picchu. Since a picture says a thousand words…</p>

			<p>Passing through such a variety of altitudes, we saw numerous microclimates hosting rich ecosystems of flora and fauna. Think giant bamboo and dense jungle treeline home to iridescent butterflies and brilliant birds, through barren landscapes with spaghetti-western style cacti. The trail is also home to a huge number of elegant and colourful orchid species.</p>

			<p>With my “human geography” hat on, the Inca settlements we saw along the way were fascinating. We visited 6 archeological sites <em>not</em> counting Machu Picchu; all with well-preserved examples of dwellings, temples, agricultural plateau and waterways fed from mountain streams. If you've ever seen the classic photos of stepped Inca settlements, some of these simply reinforced the mountain face for construction; others are agricultural land for planting ordered rows of crops. The Andean people would experiment and work out which crops fared best at different altitudes, planting higher or lower accordingly.</p>

			<h3>Machu Picchu</h3>
			
			<p>I'd seen a lot of photos of Machu Picchu before we even contemplated visiting Peru and I honestly thought that after the déjà vu, the hype, the crowds (5000 visitors per day!) and the other Inca sites that it might be a let down. Fortunately that wasn't the case. When we arrived at the Sun Gate, our first sighting - though from afar - swept those preconceptions away. No pictures or stories (irony noted again) can capture the grandeur of the city nestled atop its mountain, flanked on all sides by towering peaks and with the sun gradually drawing back the blanket of night-time.</p>

			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190524-16.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>As we worked our way down from our vantage point (around 2km walk above) we took a great many identical photos...</p>

			<img class="lazy size-4" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190524-17.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">

			<p>Inside, Miguel gave us a tour of the salient sights and history.</p>

			<p>Machu Picchu was (re-)discovered by Hiram Bingham in 1911 whilst looking for the “last refuge” of the Incas. Since the Spanish never found it, there is no conclusive record of what the settlement was used for. The best working theory we were told was that it was a noble site and administrative centre, as common folk wouldn't know the location of noble sites and so wouldn't have given it away when tortured. The number of temples within the city also supports this theory, whilst the 6-8 different trails linked to it lend credit to it being an important administrative centre.</p>

			<p>The publication of Bingham's photos in <em>National Geographic</em> brought Machu Picchu to the worldwide eye, but in reality it had likely been discovered by various people beforehand. Others had plundered its precious metal relics and had kept its location secret for profit. There were also Peruvian families living nearby in the hills - it was ultimately a local 11-year-old who pointed the way to Bingham!</p>

			<p>Inca temples are easily distinguished from less important buildings by the mortarless, geometrically interlocked stonework. Other dwellings have much rougher construction using mud and alpaca hair mortar. The grand <em>Sun Temple</em> was the first place that Bingham found, assuming it to be the royal mausoleum of the great Inca leader Pachacutec. The temple was actually used to manage spiritual rituals and agriculture through the annual calendar of Inca life. The sun rises through the centre of a far off V-shaped mountain ridge on the 21st June directly through the window of the temple. On the opposite equinox on 21st December it aligns through the Sun Gate.</p>

			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190524-20.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>Other notable sites included the <em>Temple of the Condor</em> (a spiritual bird for the Andean people) and the <em>Roca Sagrada</em> (sacred rock) which was carved to resemble the far off mountain range, since the Incas also revered glacial mountains.</p>

			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190524-21.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<h3>Other</h3>
			
			<p>The food we ate on the trek was spectacular. Amongst our porters we had a fantastic (if dour) chef called Walter who managed to rustle up unimaginable delicacies using only a gas stove. He even whipped up a fully iced cake for our last evening:</p>

			<img class="lazy size-1" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190524-23.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>Christina led us all in an evening yoga session after each walk; set up in the mountain air this was deeply relaxing and really helped loosen off the muscles!</p>

			<h3>Summary</h3>
			
			<p>Walking for 4 days over original Inca stone-paved trails through mountainous Peru was an unforgettable experience. With only 200 tourists per day granted permits to do so and with our group moving at a decent pace, we were able to take in the sights in relative tranquility. The “lost city of the Incas” definitely seems a worthy ‘new wonder of the world’ and it's easy to see how it became hidden under the rich vegetation. Certainly one of my highlights of Latin America (and a very long blog!).</p>

			<h2>Cusco - navel of the world</h2>
			
			<p>A 90 minute cheap flight saved us a 24 hour bus from Lima to Cusco; a choice our previous AirBnB host congratulated us on.</p>

			<p>Cusco was our jumping off point for the Inca Trail and Machu Picchu, and where Laura joined us for the following 2 and a half weeks!</p>

			<p>We had a day before she arrived, so Charlotte and I visited the Pisaq archeological site in the Incan Sacred Valley, which stretches North of the city.</p>

			
			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190516-01.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>Pisaq is a small market town around 45 minutes north of Cusco, where the bridge to the centre is lined with taxis and eager auto-rickshaw drivers vying to convince you to take an overinflated fare to the far gates of the archeological site. Walk on through the town and at the North end you find a stone path leading through the mountains allowing arrival by foot.</p>

			<p>We had read helpfully conflicting reports that the trek took anywhere between 90 minutes and 3 hours due to the consistent, sharp and unrelenting trajectory of the trail. The problem with blogs (irony noted) is you never know how much to take at face value. In spite of many recommendations to leave a few days to acclimatise to the altitude before attempting anything taxing, we decided we would give it a crack. The theory being we had spent most of our travels at altitude, and could always turn around and come down if we started to suffer.</p>

			<p>The reports of the incline turned out to be pretty accurate. The trail was almost entirely uphill, but the views were ample reward. We rose steeply and immediately into the mountains, affording views back over the town and the neighbouring valleys from the start. The taxis offering door to door service to the top site removed any also-rans from the trail, which made for a peaceful and serene walk. There were immaculately preserved remains of Incan settlements along the duration, and since the top site was so easily accessible by road, those on the trail were almost deserted. Given the reports of crowds ahead at Machu Picchu, this felt like a real treat! We saw fantastic examples of stone aqueducts and waterways, and the sunlight washed the stonework in a timeless, ethereal, golden glow.</p>

			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190516-03.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>Some of the buildings were excellent examples of the fine stone-carving for which the Incas were known. A little reading before we set off allowed me to act as tour guide and note that the perfectly interlocking geometric blocks required no mortar and have been able to withstand hundreds of years of earthquakes intact.</p>

			<p>The walk up actually took around an hour and 40 minutes including stops at several sites along the way, which felt like pretty good going. The way down was faster again (surprise surprise), especially with the aid of some Oreos to refuel along the way.</p>

			<p>In the evening we had the romantic meal that we eschewed in Lima at a vegan restaurant called Green Point. They served an incredible cashew curry and cocktails made with Pisco, blueberry, rosemary and many other floral ingredients. The chocolate cake (gluten and dairy free) was also exquisite.</p>

			
			<img class="lazy size-1" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190516-10.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>The next day we holed up in a sunny courtyard coffee shop called “Three Monkeys”- one of the best cups of coffee I've had in South America - to await Laura's arrival on the morning flight from Bogotá. Having spent 17 and a half hours travelling from near sea level in London (circa 10m ) and arriving at 3400m in Cusco, we decided a walking tour of the city would be a suitably gentle introduction to the time zone.</p>

			<p>Cusco's old town is absolutely beautiful, its cobbled streets flanked by high and imposing Incan stone walls and peppered with the Colonial grandeur of town houses enclosing picturesque square plazas. The walking tour added some history and background to the grandeur. Highlights included:
			<p>
			<ul>
			<li>The Incas conquered the first inhabitants of Cusco in the 1100s</li>
			<li>Q'osqo - the original Quechuan - means <em>navel</em>, as they considered this locatiton the centre of the world and of their empire</li>
			<li>The Quechua language, though widely spoken, is not widely read or written as it is learned orally. Only a few years ago an institute for the study of the written form opened in Cusco</li>
			<li>Pizarro arrived in Peru in 1532; in 1533 he took over a weakened and divided Cusco blighted by infighting between 2 brothers who had been (un-traditionally) left the Incan empire by their father, the former ruler. <b>180 Spaniards</b> defeated around <b>2 million Incas,</b></li>
			<li>Cusco's San Pedro market had the same architect as the Eiffel tower; it looks <b>nothing</b> like it</li>
			<li>Cusco has the oldest church in South America, and it contains a painting of the last supper where dinner is a whole Guinea pig  - <em>“Cuy”</em></li>
			<li>There are 80 million Guinea pigs in Peru - bred for food not as pets</li>
			<li>[Charlotte and Laura were delighted to hear that] chocolate can help with altitude sickness since sugar helps produce red blood cells to increase blood transport of oxygen</li>
			</ul></p>

			<p>On our last day in Cusco we walked up to the Sacksay Waman (absolutely not to be pronounced sexy woman) archeological site above Cusco. Compared to Pisaq, this was impressively large and expansive. It had a temple site that, whilst demolished by the Spaniards, you could make out as a grand structure from its circular profile on the ground. Scholars maintain it had 3 floors of alternating square and circular profile and was a temple to the sun. The view over Cusco from the site was also spectacular.</p>

			<p>Before we attended our evening Inca Trail briefing, we stopped at a bar overlooking Plaza Mayor for some happy hour Pisco sours. The view over the square and the wider city as the sun set over mingling Cusqueñans and tourists was magical. The 2 cocktails each made the briefing fly by and helped with an early night before our 4am departure for the Inca Trail - but that subject needs its own blog!</p>

			<h2>Darkest Peru - Lima</h2>
			
			<p>So, we've reached our 3rd country - Peru! Home of the spectacled bear that inspired <em>Paddington</em> (I had to include that somewhere and it doesn't really fit anywhere else in the blog).</p>

			<p>Our time in Lima was limited - we were mostly using it as a stopover on the way to Cusco, further south. We stayed at an Airbnb hosted by a lovely Peruvian couple in the hip, middle class <em>Miraflores</em> district. Miraflores boasts luxury sea-facing apartment blocks where the wealthier Peruvians of the capital can watch the sun rise over the local surfer population.</p>

			<p>We only really had one day in the capital, which also happened to be the 6th anniversary of Charlotte and I being together, so we started with a fancy breakfast at a local bakery. This got thing off to a good start, as it included the best almond croissant I've ever eaten (also probably the best croissant that I've had outside of France).</p>

			
			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190513-01.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>After our delectable desayuno, we joined a walking tour of the old town to understand a little of Peru's history. Strap in...</p>

			<p>The city was originally named <em>Rimac</em>, which is the name of the river that bisects the city. In Quechuan (the native Andean language) this means “talkative”, - in the wet season the river is said to become so full of energy that it seems to be talking. The present name of <em>Lima</em> is the Castilian version of the name, given by Francisco Pizarro when the Spanish arrived.</p>

			<p>The first Dominican Catholics from Spain arrived in 1532, using their righteous message of the Lord as a convenient excuse to conquer and plunder the resource-rich Andean region. Our tour took us to the first Dominican church in the whole of South America, <em>Basilica del Santo Domingo</em>. Construction of this began in 1541 by Catalonian immigrants and the majority of the roof and interior in clad in Cedar wood. This means that unlike a lot of Catholic churches, you won't see vast numbers of openly burning candles!</p>

			
			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190513-02.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>The church also houses an altarpiece paying homage to San Martin de Porres, the first black Saint in all of South America. Our tour guide <em>Pepelucho</em> explained to us that the Vatican requires 3 recorded miracles in order to grant a sainthood. For San Martin de Porres, these were levitation, bilocation (being present in 2 places at the same time) and walking through closed doors. Those last two sound like real time-savers for a busy Saint. Under his carved figure lays visible his original skull, now over 400 years old.</p>

			
			<img class="lazy size-4" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190513-03.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>Looking back at pre-colonial Peru, the civilisation that I'll dwell on longer in subsequent blogs is of course the Incan empire. In Lima's old town they have a monument dedicated to Taulicjusco - the last Inca general - which is a large rock that was brought from Cusco. They really liked rocks; again, more on that later...</p>
			
			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190513-04.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>Much of the architecture of the historic old town is very Colonial, with notable Arabic influence from the last Arab invasion of Spain that preceded the Spanish conquests. This architecture can be seen in the flying balconies, cedar decoration and colours of the Spanish flag - the picture below is Plaza de Armas, where Pizarro ordered all the surrounding buildings to be painted yellow.</p>

			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190513-05.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>Plaza de Armas also hosts the president's offices, and at midday has the regal changing of the guards ceremony. The colourfully attired guards march with highly flung limbs across the courtyard towards each other (incredibly slowly), as a full military band keeps time. The band were occasionally over-dramatic, setting the occasion to Carl Orff's “O Fortuna” from “Carmina Burana”, which you can hear in the video below.</p>

			<p>Wandering around Lima, you can see the below symbol on many buildings. It identifies sites that were originally Andean mud and stone construction, now identified as UNESCO Human Heritage sites. It's the sort of thing that once pointed out you start seeing everywhere, which gives an interesting perspective on the size of the original settlement as you wander  the cobbled streets.</p>

			<p>After the tour we had a set menu lunch with our first taste of authentic ceviche in Peru, which was deliciously fresh, spicy and citrusy. I've made a mental note to try it with mackerel the next time I go fishing.</p>

			<p>Our evening in Lima before our flight to Cusco was a little less cultural in the traditional sense. We went to the cinema to watch the new Avengers film - happy anniversary, Charlotte!</p>

			<h2>Playa los Frailes - move over Bear Grylls
			</h2>
			<p>50¢ gets you a fair distance in Ecuador. In this very specific example, it gets you from Puerto López to the gates of the Parque Nacional Machalilla. Not content with the swarming sunbathers of Montañita and the flocks of fishermen of Puerto López, we entered the national park in search of the idyllic white sands of Playa los Frailes - <em>en. Friars’ beach</em>.</p>

			<p>It lies a 90 minute walk through undulating dry forest, which provides less shade than you might expect - not a journey to be taken lightly in the burning equatorial sun. Nevertheless, with the aid of some locally sourced walking sticks, we set off in high spirits.</p>

			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190510-01.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>Around 40 minutes in, temperatures were high and shelter low when we happened upon an interim stop. Playa Prieta - a small deserted cove with shallow, crystal clear water lapping over sharp reef. The cooling breeze across the water reinvigorated us for the walk on to our ultimate destination - we were forewarned that swimming here was not safe.</p>

			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190510-02.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>After a further 30 minutes or so passing more jungle, picture perfect vistas and another rock-strewn beach, we reached a fork in the path. One trail led to the beach and the other to the viewpoint across Playa los Frailes. I made the unpopular decision that we should climb the steep hill (in the 33°C midday heat) to the top of the headland - <em>“we're only here once”</em>.</p>

			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190510-03.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190510-04.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>Whilst we were overheated and over-perspired after the climb, the view from the peak gave us our first sweeping panorama over the beach we had hiked to see. True to guidebooks and online “must see” articles it was polaroid-perfect - a long, bleached crescent of deserted sand lined by deep blue water. There was also a mercifully cool breeze to restore some normality to our core temperature.</p>

			<img class="lazy size-4" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190510-05.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>Re-energised but nevertheless desperate by this point for a cleansing dip in the ocean, we hurried back down the trail to the beach.</p>

			<p>Before diving head-first into the redeeming water, there was the small matter of the landscape to deal with. By this I mean that the beach provides precisely zero shelter from the ground-scorching heat of the overhead sun. We dealt with this by constructing a makeshift shelter using stray tree branches and one of our towels, held together with shoelaces and hair ties. This was surprisingly and thankfully effective - Bear Grylls would be proud.</p>

			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190510-06.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>After the strains of our beach-side construction project, we made swiftly for the water. It was so pleasantly cool and magically set amongst the cliffs and sand that I could have quite happily spent all day bobbing around. Therefore in spite of the engineering marvel that was our shelter whilst we were on land, we spent so much time in the sea that our backs were lobster-red at the end of the day…</p>

			<p>As we departed from one of the most blissful beach days I've had in years, we strolled along the beach to the site of more brown pelicans fishing and crabs scuttling along the sand. With the quiet tranquility of the beach, both sets of creatures carried about their evening rituals with little regard for us, so I was able to get some better photos than on our previous sightings!</p>

			<h2>Treasure, Turtles and Bizarre Birds
			</h2>
			<p>North of Montañita lies the fishing town of Puerto López. It's a quiet place save for the waterfront, which hosts restaurants and a plethora of small beach bars geared up for serving cocktails in high season. Since we were visiting at the end of the rainy season (more on that later), they were all mostly deserted!</p>

			<p>We arrived in the afternoon and spent the remainder of the day on the beach. We based ourselves on the opposite end to the fishing boats, since every morning hundreds of fishermen land directly onto the sand with the night's catch, which results in a lot of detritus left behind in the form of stray fish or parts thereof. We also booked ourselves onto a boat to Isla de la Plata the following day, which was our principal reason for visiting the town.</p>

			<img class="lazy size-4" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190507-01.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>The boat set off the following morning at 9am for the 2 hour journey to the small island. Isla de la Plata differs geographically from the Galapagos in that it was historically part of the continental plate attached to mainland South America, rather than a volcanic uprising. Its similarities are in the rich ecosystem of wildlife that inhabit it.</p>
			
			<img class="lazy size-4" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190507-02.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>Our arrival got us off to a fantastic start, as a neighbouring boat captain alerted us to a group of turtles that swam right up to the surface around our boat as we were anchoring offshore.</p>
			
			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190507-03.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>Once we disembarked, we set about hiking to the far side of the island in search of wildlife with our guide Adan, who gave us the history. The name Isla de la Plata has a few possible explanations. Literally “Island of the Silver”, legend has it that Sir Francis Drake set sail from the coast of Ecuador with an extravagant plunder of silver, so much so that his ship was too laden to effectively navigate the rough seas of the Pacific. In order to ensure safe passage back to England, he supposedly dumped a bounty of metal into the waters off the island. Such a treasure trove has never been recorded as found. Another explanation is that the name relates to the colour of the cliffs, which shine silver in the melting evening sun due to the whitewash of Guano from the large bird population.</p>

			<p>So, to the birds. Isla de la Plata is home to the fantastically named and dumbfounding <em>Blue Footed Boobies</em>. They are large sea birds wothy bright blue webbed feet, which they develop over the course of their life (they are not born that way) through a diet of sardines and flying fish, which contain a blue pigment.</p>
			
			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190507-04.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			<img class="lazy size-4" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190507-05.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>They catch their food by diving at 100km/h into the sea, so we were warned to keep our distance from them due to their incredibly strong necks and bite. This was easier said than done, given that they were perched near or on the path all the way across the island!</p>
			
			<p>The birds’ webbed feet are evolved to moderate the temperature of their eggs. They nest on the ground, which provides some natural heat, and they will stand on top of the eggs to keep them warm over the 45 days they take to hatch. Whilst we were technically visiting the island in the wet season which runs January to April, the rains had already finished early. This meant that the boobies had laid their eggs early by mistake. So, they were instead to be seen standing either side of the eggs, allowing the breeze to cool them.</p>

			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190507-06.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>The cooling was necessary since the temperature in the wet season gets up to 45°C and aside from the few hours of afternoon downpour, the rainy season counterintuitively has bright sunshine for most of the day. By contrast, the dry season which runs May to December averages 18-24°C and has more or less complete cloud cover. So with blind luck we managed to get the best weather of the year for our visit!</p>

			<p>The northern cliffs of the island house birds <b>everywhere</b>, also including the Nazca Boobie and droves of Frigate birds. The blue footed boobies were tucked into the cliffs en masses above picture-perfect - if inaccessible - beaches with bright white sand and sapphire-blue water.</p>

			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190507-08.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>Once we returned to the boat, we took to the water to snorkel around the coral reefs of the island. The reefs are in relatively good condition, since the island and its surrounding 2km of water form a national park where fishing is prohibited. </p>

			<p>The visibility for snorkeling was pretty good and we spent a happy hour swimming with the colourful and exotic scholes. I even managed get a selfie with some John Dory fish.</p>

			<p>We were told we had a chance of seeing more turtles while snorkeling, which Charlotte's keen eye spotted in one of the deeper areas about half an hour in. Whilst it was already retreating, I managed to chase it down and dive to grab a video of it. Galapagos eat your heart out!</p>

			<p>Overall it was a fantastic day trip and probably one of the highlights of our trip so far, what with the combination of the weather, the wildlife and my love of boating.</p>

			<h2>Montañita - sun, sand and surf</h2>
			
			<p>We arrived in the seaside town of Montañita at around 8.30am, dazed from a 9 hour overnight bus from Baños to Santa Elena and a 1.5 hour onward connection from there. On the subject, I've been very impressed by the buses so far in both Colombia and Ecuador, they're frequent, organised, fast, comfortable and cheap. They also often have a big screen TV at the front showing an action film. Turns out Liam Neeson's “I will find you, and I will kill you” speech from <em>Taken</em> is just as dramatic in Spanish. All this aside, an overnight bus was never going to give a decent night's sleep so it was a dream to arrive at our hostel to several cups of free coffee.</p>

			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190430-01.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>Montañita beach is a long stretch of postcard white sand that provides a consistent beach break for good surf at high tide, with a reef at the north end that supposedly works through the tides on a larger swell. It's Ecuador's main surf break so the town has developed into a really vibrant backpackers’ haven, with all the cheap hostels, surfboard rental huts, western food and cocktails you could want. Our hostel was a recommendation from a Swedish girl we met on our rafting trip - a super-chilled place called Mamacucha. This was run by a larger-than-life character who called everyone “hermano” and introduced himself as <em>Colorado</em>. He bore a striking resemblance to a Spanish Chris O'Dowd and I really struggled for some reason to not keep calling him “Colombo”.</p>

			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190430-02.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>Free coffee aside, the hostel had a great bar/common area to sit and relax, trade travelling stories with to the other guests and drink very cheap beer and mojitos. They also put on a fantastic all-you-can-eat empanada night where all the guests sat around a long table learning how to correctly fill and crimp the pastry (pasty making was good base knowledge) and eating the results over a few drinks.</p>

			<p>We spent a couple of days chilling on the beach and in the hostel, surfing in the later afternoon and into sunset. As the tide pushed in, all of the travellers and local heroes took to the water to form a crowded but friendly lineup. Charlotte, ever persistent in her surf progression, paddled out back at the perfect moment on our second day and we watched a pod of dolphins feeding whilst the brown pelicans swooped down to snatch the stray fish left behind. It's the closest I've been to dolphins (just a few metres) in probably 10 years!</p>

			<p>The food highlight in Montañita was unashamedly the local legend that is Ezzio's pizza, where they serve you a filling, fully loaded individual pizza for $3. Their joint is located on “cocktail alley”, where in the evening tens of cocktail stands open up on both sides of the street, offering a large plastic beaker of your chosen elixir for $3 flat, and they don't go easy on the measures!</p>

			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190430-03.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>Whilst we were based in Montañita, we took a walk around the headland to the next town of Olón. This was labelled on the hostel map as 20 minutes but was more accurately 40 down the main road, with very little shade from the blistering equatorial sun. However, the rewards for the walk we're ample. Where Montañita had the people and the surf, Olón had the quiet, open, tranquil sands.</p>

			<img class="lazy size-4" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190430-05.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>It was mid-day when we got there and since we'd already learned the hard way to stay out of the sun during the middle of the day, we retreated into a local beachfront gaffe for a set <em>almuerzo</em>. This finally took the lead from the mountain lunch in Minka, Colombia as my best meal so far. Starter was a rich fish broth with some kind of local corn and yuka; main was lightly battered fried white fish with crisped plantain chips, rice and a red onion and tomato ceviche. It was absolutely spectacular at $3.50 with a glass of coke.</p>

			<p>After the sun moved a little past its peak we spent the afternoon sunbathing, swimming, and watching the wildlife. I already mentioned the brown pelicans; these are in abundance along the coast. They are majestic birds, with a wingspan nearing 2 metres and a penchant for gliding gracefully on the currents, just above the water's surface. Towards sunset they started fishing, which involved hovering to scout for fish, then launching into a vertical dive into the water. You could see the bulge in their low-hanging bills from a successful catch!</p>

			<img class="lazy size-4" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190430-06.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>There were also frigate birds in number circling the beach above, and on the sand were the fascinating sand bubbler crabs. These are the sort you watch and hear Sir David Attenborough narrating in your head, as they pop out of their holes, rolling tightly packed little balls of sand, which they carry away from their hole and disappear back down to dig further. Photography was difficult as even my most nimble footsteps in the sand sent them scuttling back to safety.</p>

			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190430-07.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>With Ecuador's coast being on the West of the continent, both Montañita and Olón had beautiful evening light and fantastic sunsets. Pictures never do justice, but watching the sun melt into the horizon whilst the waves lapped the shore was truly blissful.</p>

			<h2>Baños - Spanish for bathrooms</h2>
			<p>Baños - the town, not to be confused with the Spanish word for bathrooms - is 2 hours by bus south of Quito, following the snaking road down the mountainous backbone of Ecuador. Its name derives from the hot springs that flow from the base of the Tungurahua volcano, which looms over 5000m above.</p>

			<p>We arrived amid preparations for Semana Santa - Easter week - which meant that unlike most of our destinations so far, the town was absolutely teeming with people. This was the first time we found any difficulty in bagging a room at our first choice hostel, as Ecuadorians arrived from around the country to enjoy the quaint town with their families. The resulting atmosphere was buzzing, with the town centre partially pedestrianised and street magicians, circus performers and eager craft sellers vying for attention. We spent plenty of time meandering the streets and mooching around the various cafés, bars and shops including the “Stray Dog” brewpub which had some great dog art: </p>

			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190427-01.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>Baños markets itself as an outdoor adventure hub, and the rivers nearby offer really good white water rafting. The numerous tour operators offer some of the cheapest rates you'll find, so we opted to take a half day rafting trip. Rafting really makes the tubing in Mindo seem tame by comparison, though at least the rocks were to be avoided in this format!</p>

			<p>After the mandatory safety briefing from our instructor <em>Willy</em> and a dunk in the water to practice re-boarding, we set off for 90 minutes of level III and IV rapids. We managed pretty well with a 7-strong team of rafters under Willy's barked instruction, as he marshalled from the bow. We had a safety kayaker ahead at all times which was useful for the point at which one of our crew fell out mid-rapid (she was fine) and also to go on ahead and capture videos and photos. Check Charlotte's lasso technique in the video (she's sat up front, me directly behind) and Willy's air guitar in the photo below. He assured us this was after he'd deemed us competent and needed to do less hands-on paddling as a result.</p>

			<p>In the evening, after we'd dried off, we headed up to the <em>Casa de Árbol</em>, which is a treehouse with a large swing over the edge of the mountain peak - you may have seen it before on Instagram. The view was quite special, with cloud swirling slowly below into the valley. The swing photo was obligatory. To be fair, it was a good swing, as swings go. We also met a friendly dog who decided to force his way into our photos.</p>

			<p>Mountain bike outfitters also abound in Baños, so after a much needed down day (our first in 3 weeks, precipitated by heavy precipitation) we hired some wheels and set off South. This meant taking the main highway; great roads but shared with huge American 18-wheelers and buses. Fortunately, most drivers gave plenty of space as it's an established cycle route but there were a few hairy overtakes by oversized petrol tankers.</p>

			<p>After 18 km or so we came across what turned out to be a major Easter tourist attraction. If you've read my posts so far you guessed it right… a waterfall! Groups of Ecuadorian Holy week tourists had arrived by the bus load in vehicles called “Chivas”. These were mid-sized, open sided tour buses, painted in garish swathes of colour and fitted with oversized PA systems blasting <b>loud</b> music. We decided to join the queue into the waterfall viewpoint to be part of the experience and ended up following a narrow path to the water single file amongst hundreds of eager revellers, whilst street food vendors roasted plantain and grilled salchichas by the side of the thoroughfare. It was an impressive waterfall, but as you can see from the photo below it was just as notable for the crowds!</p>

			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190427-06.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>After cycling a little further and lunch at a local café (and another cascada), we decided to bus back to Baños rather than re-tracing the highway for 20 km uphill. A bus isn't quite what we ended up on. In actuality we hopped in the back of a truck with the fading perfume of agricultural use whose driver was making a few quick bucks by loading up with weary cyclists. He had 2 wooden benches down the sides of the vehicle, similar to what you might sit on in a primary school assembly hall. The bikes were piled high across the tailgate. This made for a slightly uncomfortable, if highly memorable ride back as we stopped and crammed unexpected numbers of bikes in and bumped along on the way back into town.</p>

			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190427-07.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>The cycle uphill into the winding mountain roads afterwards was definitely more pleasant than the return highway journey.</p>

			<p>Having spent the day pedalling, we went for an evening soak in the thermal baths as the sun set behind the volcano. The peak of Tungurahua had remained elusive until this point due to clouds but as we were walking up to the baths it finally peeped through:</p>

			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190427-10.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>The baths themselves were pleasant enough, with options spanning uncomfortably warm to probably-too-tepid. This was seemingly off the foreign tourist trail (a lot of the hotels have their own onsite baths) so we enjoyed feeling part of the local crowd whiling away the evening in matching obligatory swimming caps. Sadly I don't have a photo of us in these but I can therefore safely assure you they were highly fashionable knitwear (yes, fabric).</p>

			<p>Summary of this part of Ecuador: mountains (abundant, large), outdoor activities (varied, numerous), waterfalls (so many).</p>

			<h2>Don't go chasing waterfalls - Mindo</h2>
			
			<p>A 3 hour bus from northern Quito took us into the “Cloud forest” town of Mindo. Whilst numerous tour agencies lined the main <em>Avenue de Quito</em>, it had a distinctly sleepy and rural feel to it which was a welcome change from bustling Quito. By contrast, there are a number of traveller-targeted activities on offer in the surrounding area.</p>
			
			<img class="lazy size-1" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190424-00.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>On our first afternoon we went “tubing” down the river Mindo. This involved hurtling downstream on 5 tractor-sized inner tubes bound together with rope as our guide (captain?) Juan Carlos jumped in and out of the water in his tracksuit and trainers, kicking us off of and onto rocks; these seemed to be seen as a feature, not an obstacle. Juan Carlos was a man of many scars - including a possible gunshot scar on his arm - and few words. His safety briefing consisted of “hold onto the ropes”. The river itself was achingly beautiful, gushing white over the boulders and flanked on either side by draping dense, green jungle foliage. Whilst holding onto the ropes for dear life I wasn't able to capture any pictures, but we did walk back upstream to grab a photo, after the ride back into town stood in the tube raft strapped to the back of the pickup truck.</p>

			<p>In the evening we went on a tour of a local chocolate farm called <em>El Quetzal.</em> It's honestly the most delicious dark chocolate I've ever eaten - I'm normally a luddite preferring the milky sweet variety. Sergio, our Portuguese guide, explained to us soup-to-nuts how they make chocolate, which is quite an involved process.</p>
			
			<ul>
			<li>First, they take the cacao fruit and extract the juicy white beans, which they ferment in their own pulp to enhance the sweet flavour, before drying them for 21 days in a greenhouse.</li>
			<li>Once dry, they are roasted for 30 minutes before being crushed to remove the cocoa nibs from the hard husks.</li>
			<li>These are separated using a hand-built machine akin to a wind-tunnel which blows the light shells aside from the heavier nibs, which fall through the airflow.</li>
			<li>The nibs can either be pressed at a pressure of 30 tonnes (using a car jack!) to separate cocoa butter from from pure cocoa for cooking, or spun and stirred for 12 hours in a hot room at 35°C to produce smooth, molten chocolate.</li>
			<li>This chocolate is tempered in a cold room at 17°C and poured into moulds to create chocolate bars that they only sell on-site.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>The only addition to the raw chocolate is cane sugar (33% maximum, 15% minimum), save for their macadamia, chili, coffee or ginger flavoured bars. All of these ingredients are also grown on-site. Having tasted large quantities all of them (as well as their brownies, cacao syrup, ginger syrup, and cacao BBQ sauce) I can confirm they are all equally spectacular. The following dinner was not, by necessity, a large meal.</p>
			
			<p><b>Fun fact:</b> Apparently, there is some concern for the longevity of the cacao plant, which has incredibly small flowers, and so is pollinated by microscopic midges that only live in equatorial regions. This means it can't be cultivated in a greenhouse since no-one has yet worked out a way to artificially pollinate it.</p>

			<p>The next day we hiked up into the forest to burn off some chocolate. We stopped off to go zip-lining over the canopy, which was a spectacular way of seeing the jungle in all its glory:</p>

			<p>We walked on up from there to take a cable car of sorts (more accurately, a metal crate on a cable attached to a petrol engine) across the valley to the neighbouring peak. This gave us access to a jungle walk via of 5 of the 7 Mindo waterfalls. You'll note South America seems to have a very high waterfall-per-capita ratio if you've read all my posts so far…</p>
			
			<p>2 of these <em>Cascadas</em> fell into deep pools that conspired with the humidity to make for a very inviting swim. The last, which was only accessible by wading through the river of the former, provided a beautiful spot for an avocado lunch. Side note - I'm trying to eat as many avocados as possible in South America, they're <b>SO</b> much better than what we import into the UK.</p>

			<p>On our final day we got up before sunrise to go bird-watching with a local guide called Irman. We spotted 44 of the 330 bird species that inhabit Mindo, including 2 varieties of toucans, 3 varieties of parrot, and a massive swallow-tailed kite. The “shiny cowbird?” was another highlight for the name alone. The toucans were the most spectacular spot, as you get a really grand reveal when they turn their beaks into profile. Short of a telephoto lens, you'll have the play “spot the parrot” in the photo below taken through Irman's birding scope.</p>

			<p>Not content with winged feathered vertebrates, we also visited a butterfly farm, where highlights included the “owl eye” butterfly. These tame fellas proved very willing for a selfie with the aid of some banana to eat from the end of my finger. The <em>Blue Morpho</em> variety was significantly more elusive - below is my best attempt.</p>

			<p>Our 3 days in Mindo were well-balanced with activities in the morning into early afternoon and downtime later in the day as the daily heavy downpour arrived. I'm not entirely convinced by the difference between a cloud forest and a rainforest…</p>

			<h2>Cotopaxi - short blog, tall volcano</h2>
			
			<p>Whilst we were still based in Quito we took a day trip to the Cotopaxi national park to ascend the 5,897m Cotopaxi volcano. Not possessing the gear for the additional 6 hour ice climb to the summit, we settled for hiking to the base of the glacier (past the refuge at 4,864m) at 5,000m.</p>
			
			<p>Our bus ride to the park gave little hope of a view as we drove within the thick cloud layer and rain buffeted the windows. Our guide was far from optimistic about the view but gave us a good overview of the bird life we were supposed to watch out for whilst we had nothing else to look at. The prize spot the mighty condor, but he warned that there are also “Caracara” birds that look very similar but are much smaller. He tickled me with his description of perceiving small caracara versus far away condors for how closely it mirrored Father Ted’s <a href="https://youtu.be/MMiKyfd6hA0">"small and far away"</a> cows scene.</p>
			
			<p>Miraculously, as we were getting stuck into our ascent - and lamenting not having brought waterproof trousers - the weather gods relented and the cloud began to clear. As we reached the glacier we began to get a glimpse towards the summit as the clouds circled like a halo around the crest. The glacier itself was quite a sight, presenting a barren, jagged and alien landscape.</p>
			
			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190422-01.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>We mountain-biked down to the lake at the base of the supervolcano (which was by far the fastest mode of transportation), and found the cloud had cleared even more to give a really spectacular vista of the peak. The picture below doesn't even get close to giving an idea of how immense Cotopaxi is in real life.</p>
			
			<img class="lazy size-4" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190422-02.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>One of the most striking things in the national park for me was that the tree line in Ecuador is at around 4,000m - in Europe we don't have mountains that tall in any case, but trees wouldn't grow much above 2,200m in the Swiss alps.<a href="https://www.webcitation.org/5yfLc2eTn?url=http://pages.unibas.ch/botschoen/treeline_elevation/index.shtml/">[1]</a> The frequently dotted warning siren stations were also a visible reminder that the volcano is already a few years past its expected next eruption date since it supposedly follows a 100-year cycle. Our guide’s advice if the sirens started - “call your mamas and tell them you love them”.</p>
			
			<p>Spoiler alert, we survived. Next stop on the road is the Mindo cloud forest.</p>

			<h2>Ecuador - a story of Ponchos and Dollars</h2>
			<h3>Otavalo and Quito</h3>
			
			<p>So we're already onto our second country - Ecuador! Everyone we've met along the way so far is incredulous that we spent just over a week in Colombia, which is a fair challenge. It's a beautiful country and I definitely want to go back to see more.</p>
			
			<p>On the plus side, Ecuador is absolutely stunning. First stop across the border (the crossing of which took an uncomfortable 6 hours) was the market town of Otavalo.</p>
			
			<p>Otavalo is nestled in the sweeping lush green mountains of northern Ecuador, where neighbouring villagers are known for crafting textiles and leather goods. Its <em>Plaza de los Ponchos</em> provides the centrepoint for the market trade of these and many other colourful goods. We went on a Wednesday; supposedly the second busiest day after Saturday. I honestly can't imagine how they would fit more stalls in the square, which was a densely woven warren of blankets, knitwear and yes, ponchos.</p>
			
			<p>We resisted the urge for unnecessary purchases, despite a keen market trader making many offers to me for an alpaca sweater to keep me warm in the 28 degree heat.</p>
			
			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190417-01.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>After the market, we took ourselves on a hike into the hills above the town, where we visited the “Arbol Milenio”, a 100-year-old tree perched atop a stunning viewpoint. A word on the weather in Ecuador so far… variable. From the viewpoint we had thunder and deeply threatening clouds in the valley to one side and sunshine to the other. This made for rather spectacular lighting for the stately tree:</p>

			<img class="lazy size-4" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190417-03.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>We walked on to a hilltop condor sanctuary that had (as well as condors) a bewildering parliament of owls of all shapes, sizes and varieties. The final stop before we walked back to the town was a spectacular waterfall called “Cascadas de Peguche”. I got incredibly wet posing for the photo below as my windmilling arms signalling “hurry up” were misinterpreted by Charlotte as “keep going”.</p>
			
			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190417-04.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>Next stop south was Ecuador's capital, Quito. Our main activity was to take a walking tour around the picturesque old town. We had a fantastic guide called Etiel who had the perfect combination of both knowledge and passion about his country and the city. We learned more about the history and politics of Ecuador and Quito than I could recount in short form here, but fun facts included:
			<ul>
			<li>Quito has <em>200</em> churches - the Spanish built one on top of every Incan temple they came across</li>
			<li>Ecuador exports 30% of the world's bananas</li>
			<li>Despite this, it's biggest export is oil</li>
			<li>Its second biggest source of income remains money sent home from abroad following mass immigration during their last economic crisis</li>
			<li>This crisis led to the demise of the Sucre, Ecuador's former currency - they have used the US dollar since the year 2000</li>
			</ul></p>

			
			<p>A little more on that last one. The Sucre experienced such massive inflation as the country lost faith in their currency that against the dollar it fell from an original value of 5 gradually to 7,000, then finally in its last months to a tragic low of 25,000 before formal “dollarisation”. Though the dollar had already been used informally for some time, the way it was adopted was hugely unpopular. The president who proposed it was ousted with some veracity, only for the subsequent president to go ahead with the plan anyway. It did have the unexpected result of making a large improvement over time to the Ecuadorian economy, but due to the point at which it was brought in - after mass inflation - it now makes imports into Ecuador very expensive. The country also struggles to control its fiscal policy, since they cannot print their own notes. They do have a limited ability to mint their own coins, but paying for anything with a 20$ note often involves the shopkeeper running next door to try to scrabble together change, such is the issue with availability of low value denominations.</p>

			<p>Overall Quito Ecuador so far gives the impression of relative affluence compared to Colombia (its public infrastructure is also fantastic), until you dig a little deeper into its economy.</p>
			
			<p>Coming up - the Cotopaxi volcano and the cloud forest town of Mindo. Stay tuned!</p>

			<h2><em>Blog</em>otá, Pasto, Laguna La Cocha*</h2>
			
			<p>We landed back into Bogotá from the coast to spend a few days exploring Colombia's capital. It's a dynamic city that feels very progressive and every bit the modern capital. We stayed in the Candelaria district in the heart of the old town, which by contrast retains a lot of Spanish colonial architecture juxtaposed with constantly changing street art.</p>
			
			<img class="lazy size-2" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190411-01.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>On the Friday and Saturday nights the area was alive with street performers, musicians and lots of young Colombians (Candelaria is in close proximity to the university district) gathering to meet and socialise. It was a really great atmosphere to soak up.</p>
			
			<p>On our first day we took the funicular railway to the peak of Montserate, one of the 2 mountains that loom high over the city. From the summit at 3200m there are fantastic views over the city, in spite of the haze of pollution that masks much of the detail. We stopped in a cafe before heading down and had a “Chocolate Santafereño” - an odd local delicacy of corn bread, soft cheese and hot chocolate. Not altogether unpleasant but I probably won't have another.</p>

			<img class="lazy size-1" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190411-03.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>The next day we joined a bicycle tour; Bogota is surprisingly bike friendly - on Sundays they even close some highways for a massive cyclathon. We took in a lot of politically motivated street art - the current president is widely despised - as well as some state-sponsored murals and visited an incredible fruit market called “Paloquemao”, where we sampled more fruits I can't name than I could shake a banana at. We also played <em>Tejo</em>. </p>
			
			<p>Tejo is Colombia's national sport, which is played by hurling large metal weights at packets of gunpowder arranged in a circle on a clay target. If you cause an explosion, you score a point! It is unsurprisingly <b>very loud</b>. You don't pay to play Tejo, you buy a crate of beer and Tejo occurs whilst drinking it. It's a sport I can really get on board with.</p>
			
			<img class="lazy size-1" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190411-05.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>Our last tourist stop was the gold museum. As stupid as it sounds, I was surprised by just how much gold they have.</p>
			
			<p>Despite the masses of gold and silver that were unceremoniously plundered by the Spanish conquistadors, the museum has an enormous collection of ornate pieces that go a long way to explaining the habits, culture, life and death of pre-colonial Latin American people. This is observed in, for example, the way they decorated and revered Shamans (holy men) as bird-men in extravagant gold jewellery, and in sculpted scenes depicting topics such as birth, death, farming and fishing. Overall a very interesting (and shiny) exhibition.</p>
			
			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190411-04.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>On our way south to the Colombia-Ecuador border, we stopped off in the town of Pasto. Not much to mentioned in Pasto itself other than our French host's restaurant recommendation of “Mister Pollo” which, aside from fried chicken, served a surprisingly delicious battered broccoli.</p>
			
			<p>From Pasto we took a day trip by local bus to the second largest lake in Colombia - Laguna La Cocha. It rained. A lot. We did have a nice hike between lakeside towns regardless, had a freshly caught rainbow trout (trucha) lunch, and got a great moody grey photo of the lake, which was stunning even in the rain.</p>

			<h2>Go Charlotte, it's your birthday</h2>
			
			<p>The 3rd April was Charlotte's 30th birthday. Shout out to everyone who sent cards (and bunting) with me for the trip - it made for a great birthday morning:</p>
			
			<img class="lazy size-1" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190407-01.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>We headed up into the mountains of the Sierra Nevada into the jungle town of Minca the night before to stay in an “Ecohab” - picture below for context - as a birthday treat. It was absolutely stunning, with sweeping views across the luscious green jungle and hummingbirds flitting around the hammocks on our balcony.</p>
			
			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190407-02.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>After cards and presents, we set off on a motorbike tour of the surrounding area. First stop was the Pozo Azul waterfall, where it seemed that most of Colombia (but no other foreigners) had had the same idea to take a dip in the cool, if not actually blue, water to beat the heat.</p>
			
			<p>Next up was La Victoria coffee plantation. If I'm honest, I'd never given much thought to how coffee is produced so the tour of the facility was fascinating. La Victoria was started by a few engineers from Europe who had come to Santa Marta to build the railway there. They planted an objectively large crop of coffee plants and so - as engineers would - set about building bespoke machinery to process the coffee from fruit to dried bean ready for export. The entire process is powered by the naturally cascading mountain water, which is channelled to drive beans through pipes that transport and sort them by quality as well as turning water wheels that move the machinery. To this day they use the original equipment so the entire place looks like a working museum.</p>
			
			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190407-03.jpeg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>Interestingly, due to the many stages in the trade and production of coffee, La Victoria have zero visibility of where their product ends up, save for the very small amount that they roast and grind on site, which was truly delicious.</p>
			
			<p>After riding up to a viewpoint where we sampled the local “puma rosa” fruit that our guides knocked down from a nearby tree, we joined them for an authentic Colombian lunch. This was served at an establishment that I honestly think might just have been a local woman's kitchen. It consisted of a delicious meat and lentil soup followed by spiced grilled pork with beans, rice and potatoes with a fruit drink; all for the princely sum of 10,000 pesos (around £2.40 at the time of writing). It is still <b>by far</b> the best meal I've eaten on our trip.</p>
			
			<p>On the way back down we stopped briefly at a hostel with giant hammocks and another cracking view (and beer) before stopping at our second, much more idyllic waterfall for another swim.</p>
			
			<img class="lazy size-4" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190407-04.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">

			<p>The ride back into Minca would have been uneventful since we'd gotten used to the undulating and unforgiving dirt track roads by this point. This was up until the point we ground to a startling halt in front of a 3ft snake in the middle of the road. He signalled to wait until it had moved off before we should attempt to pass. When I asked him what type of snake it was, he was only able to confirm vehemently that it was <em>“peligroso”</em> -  dangerous.</p>
			
			<p>In the evening we retired to our idyllic lodgings to watch the sunset and the birds. Needless to say our standard of accommodation can only go down from here…</p>

			<h2>Bienvenido a Colombia</h2>
			
			<p>So we've arrived in South America! Specifically, Bogotá El Dorado international airport, Colombia, on Saturday afternoon. Given the 4am start in the UK and the 14hrs of travel, we very much crashed out on arrival!</p>
			
			<p>The following morning we began proper, hopping on another flight to Santa Marta on the Caribbean coast. We stayed in an incredibly chilled out hostel called The Dreamer, which caters to backpackers who want sun, a pool and beer served all day and night...</p>
			
			<img class="lazy size-1" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190403-01.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>Our first afternoon there we bussed into town. Bus drivers in Colombia are masters of multitasking - simultaneously weaving through traffic, collecting fares, distributing change, paying the bloke washing the windscreen and buying bottled water through the cab window. From the seat behind, Charlotte's job was to pass change to those retreating for seats to avoid being knocked for 6 by the next gear change.</p>
			
			<p>The beach front of Santa Marta is somewhat blighted by the enormous shipping port in the backdrop, but was a great place to people-watch with a cold drink and turn down various offers of “sunglasses” - every vendor seemed to have only 1 sunglasses case which was filled with drugs - and to absorb the colour and the Latin music blaring from every taverna and street seller. The old town had an air of its colonial past (nice basilica, pictured below) but felt weathered by tourism. Santa Marta is where the Colombians come to holiday.</p>

			<p>The next day we headed for the Tayrona national park to see some less commercialised  coast reached through the jungle. The park is massive - our hike in from the entry gate was one of the shorter routes available at a humid 2 hours, after which the cool water of the sea and lunch of fresh avocado really took the edge off.</p>
			
			<img class="lazy size-3" src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="assets/images/20190403-04.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be a photo here, honest!">
			
			<p>On the trek back we met up with a couple of Canadians who we'd met on the morning and hit Attenborough mode; we clocked an Agouti (think 2ft-long guinea pig - bugger to photograph), some woodpeckers and 3 different varieties of monkey (which the Canadians were super excited about). You can play spot the monkey on the photo below!</p>
