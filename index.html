			<p>On the 30th March 2019, Charlotte and I set off travelling around the world for 6 months, taking a break from work and experiencing a lot of new cultures and visiting a lot of places we've wanted to go to for a long time.</p>
			
			<p>During that time I plan to be relatively infrequently in contact - I won't be screening messages, but I also won't be able to give good updates on what we're up to along the way as I'll end up repeating myself ad nauseum.</p>
			
			<p>So that's where this website comes in! I'll be endeavouring to write a weekly blog with a brief update as to what we've been doing, where we've been and where we're heading to next - hopefully with some pictures.</p>
			
			<p>For anyone that's interested, this will hopefully give you a way of keeping up with what we're doing (even if you only scroll through and look at the pictures) but more than that it will force me to regularly take stock and appreciate being free and nomadic for 6 months, and thoroughly enjoying life, as well as giving me a good record to look back on fondly in the future.</p>
			
			<p>I thank Charlotte in advance for putting up with the hours I'll likely spend writing and re-writing this and playing with the code on the website to try to understand why I can't make it look like I want to make it look like!</p>
